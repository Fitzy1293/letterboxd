<br><b>1: Ecco</b>
<br><p>this is a lil too classy to be grade-A mondo trash but as pompous narrator george sanders sez its "rabelaisian good fun!" (lol) and looks incredible even on my old swv dvd. "nobody loves documentaries, but many people do find them restful" - leslie nielsen, an american carol</p>
<br><b>2: An American Carol</b>
<br><p>spent xmas watching the dickens carol adaptation with maybe the funniest trailer of all time, which i used to inflict on all my friends 10 years ago but never actually watched the thing itself til this lonely holiday of 2020. unlike 99% of right-wing comedy theres actually funny jokes in this, even if we're nowhere near naked gun (even 33 1/3) territory - i think ppl overestimate how not-political earlier zucker comedies were, which are full of lazy hippie-punching, racist stereotypes &amp; cold/gulf-war imperialist propaganda done with a wink that couldnt've been more obv if it was approved by reagan's state dept - this just makes the pro-war crimes stuff less ironic. the idea of replacing ebeneezer scrooge going bah-humbug towards christmas &amp; charity with michael moore (i mean, malone) humbugging u.s. soldiers &amp; patriotism is an.... interesting one, especially from a post-9/11 non-christian filmmaker making the american war machine bigger than christ himself ("nobody can serve god and the military," as raphael warnock says 7-8 times every atlanta commercial break) culminating in tiny tim squeaking out "god bless us and god bless america!" which'd be funnier if he said "god bless guantanamo bay" or something but still feels like an inverted situationist prank on the sentiment, like one of those chilean marxist donald duck comix done MEET THE SPARTANS-style. documentaries are boring? i for one would love to see michael malone's films "die you american pigs" and "suck a big one, america" (lmao)</p><p>basically michael moore (the surviving farley brother, cast on some decoteau beach babes sibling-name shit but actually p funny) is so horny hes constantly groping women &amp; so fat he eats old pizza with a mouse running around on it (??) but hes also mad about some july 4th country music tribute to america concert so he tries to boycott/protest it and gets visited by a bad jfk impersonator (in the jacob marley role) introducing him to the ghosts of general patton, george washington (midnight cowboi jon voight, talking about 9/11), bill oreilly, trace adkins and james woods ("nobody wants to see americans screwed by foreigners except in porn") who reprogram him to love amerikkka by showing rejected funnyordie skits about commies</p><p>tons of movie refs (i miss the mid-00s culture war with our country torn over the political cinema of oliver stone and brian de palma) &amp; insane hollywood cast, with fine turns from geoffrey arend, maniac cop's robert davi, who never once says "it must be weird not having anybody cum on you" (verhoeven or cohen wouldve directed the hell outta this!!) and kelsey grammer portraying the famously anti-semitic patton as craving a manhattan deli pastrami &amp; bopping along to slaves singing "hava nagila" (somebodys gotta sample frasier boasting "youre the biggest slaveowner in the state!") while gunning down ACLU lawyers like a boogaloo phantasm II. actually beyond dickens' ghosts theres kind of a weird splatter/george romero thing here, with psychotic soldiers shooting down zombies like its day of the dead &amp; leslie nielsen kinda looking like he does in creepshow (and what i think is a jason ref? "college kids flock to my movies" "they flock to slasher movies. they go to your movies cuz their professors tell them to"--did zucker write this slam in 1983??)</p><p>like any of these, theres plenty of dud jokes, inc. the mel brooks disease of putting "funny" songs in a spoof (&amp; ripping off mel's 10 commandments gag from history of the world) but i laffed at a quickie larry craig "wide stance" ref only nerds from 2007 will remember, some classic bad taste crippled children/suicide bomber jokes, an awards show with paris hilton &amp; gay pornstar/rapper simon rex presenting the "leni riefenstahl award for documentary filmmaking" to kevin sorbo (somehow not to kathryn bigelow), and a scene where a field of biracial enslaved children say "bye daddy!" to a horrified kevin farley, obv the inspiration for a similar sick joke in DJANGO UNCHAINED. speaking of showgirls i kept thinking of joe eszterhas/alan smithee's BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN, which is prob a good measure of if youll be able to stomach this crap, but with a few mild changes in tone &amp; targets this isnt rly that far off from sasha baron cohens stuff, or sandler's zohan (which shares its "swarthy arab terrorists played by non-arabs" casting) while honestly most of the lib slams would play well with modern DSA patreon/podcast rubes who spend every day getting way too mad at nancy pelosi, like wooahh.... can you believe the hypocrisy of limosine celebs pledging love of the proletariat while.... eating lobster???? lets post about it every day!!!--its kinda amazing how bush-era FWD: FWD: FWD: DUMBOCRATS uncle emails about libs as decadent amoral perverts have aged into millennial stock-humorm substituting for a politics (i hope at some point my generation will stop obsessing over the realization that barack obama doesnt care about them). then again, half of this didnt even make sense at the time, much less in the in the mask-off trump era - anti-war lefty protestors are slammed as pro-hitler (wonder what zucker thinks of this now) &amp; against union troops fighting the civil war (???) tho weirdly its right-wing revisionist jfk worship turned out to be some proto-#q shit (maybe just cuz zucker is a reformed dem) while still mocking 9/11 truthers as... fat</p><p>also leslie nielsen narrates but never once says "when lava pours out near the sea surface, tremendous volcanic explosions sometimes occur" tho they do play a gong when he mentions afghanistan--this movie cant even do racism right. merry xmas!!!</p>


<br><b>3: Beware The Eye Of Amun Ra</b>
<br><p>smoking on that veggietales got me entombed like neferhotep</p>
<br><b>4: Spaceship Earth 2020</b>
<br><p>sealed away in a locked dome is what should happen to whoever composed the score for this</p>
<br><b>5: The Crawlers</b>
<br><p>i watched this on christmas without even remembering it has a christmas ending, i just like the crawlers</p>
<br><b>6: Slay Belles</b>
<br><p>"oh my god did you see the look on santa's face??" </p><p>impossible to dislike if you like this sorta thing. feels like a corny '98 fox family "25 days of christmas!" movie but with boobs &amp; blood, a real troma/hallmark collabo done as loud &amp; colorful as possible in a great, real location packed w/ enthusiastically bad jokes &amp; shenanigans from a trio of candy-goth dubstep punkettes who i think have a j.r. "bob" dobbs sticker on their van. for low-budget horror trash this is packed with inventive hijinks, gags &amp; twists, the level of goofy sorority-babes crap full moon would be making now if they actually gave a shit (evil bong/corona zombies-style) so even when the camera cant hold steady or it leans too hard on the joke of anime-wig youtubers chirping sweet christmas phrases with fuck or shit inserted ("goody fuckin gumdrops!" "santa claus is comin to town, bitches!") the overwhelming cheap plasticky zeal, incredible creature/costume design, santa's ex reveal &amp; lil' gremlin hairball critters finally melted my icy heart. i think they legit got barry bostwick drunk for this!</p>


<br><b>7: The Minion</b>
<br><p>im pretty dumb so trust me when i say this movie is a lil too dumb. cool guys in shit like this are always saying "some questions are best left......unanswered." does anybody actually believe that? real donald kaufman shit</p>
<br><b>8: Jack Frost 1997</b>
<br><p>i remember watching this as a kid thinking it must be the most amateur/bootleg shit ever made and now it feels too smarmy &amp; slick to get more than 4 stars from my s.o.v.-addled poloniac brain... time is a fire in which we burn</p>

<br><b>13: A Very Merry Cricket</b>
<br><p>realistically at least one of the neon signs in times square should be advertising DEEP THROAT</p>
<br><b>14: Its A Wonderful Life</b>
<br><p>why are angels talking about IQ? yall some marks for this cornball shit</p>
<br><b>15: Bikini Bloodbath Christmas</b>
<br><p>dunno why a christmas slasher has an extended krull parody but im ok with it, impressed to see 30 secs of debbie rochon + onscreen representation of pimp c's eternal obsession the hairy asshole ("you can wax yo shit smooth / but then my dick never move") spurting both hard &amp; soft turds. sadly the rest is blumpkin/bloodfart-level unfunny improv, complete w/ nonstop "chicks with dicks" jokes; lloyd kaufman (of course) ends his cameo saying "excuse me, i have to go rape a pregnant woman"</p>
<br><b>16: Jingle All The Way</b>
<br><p>somehow never saw this &amp; always figured it was one of those xmas nostalgia faves stupid ppl inexplicably love (like christmas with the kranks, the worst movie ever made) but it kinda rips... opens with richard moll <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/thats-no-bull-richard-moll-x-charles-band/" rel="nofollow">(DUNGEONMASTER/RAGEWAR, METALSTORM: THE DESTRUCTION OF JARED-SYN)</a> blasting lazers at vasquez rocks like an empire/charlie band production, then settles into a p funny/quasi-delilloian "one crazy day!!" comedy with a dark, cynical sense of humor obv written by a genre/horror/thriller guy* (the set-up is essentially CHILDS PLAY) that even sorta feels like classic simpsons if u squint, not just cuz phil hartman is playing ned flanders (but horny)* and weird "bart worships krusty/radioactive man but doesnt realize his own father is a fat alcoholic clown &amp; literal radioactive man" plot, landing somewhere between some shit like miracle mile (starring arnold-double brian thompson), an actually-good 90s cult comedy like the cable guy (or bad santa) and whatever cheezy home alone ripoff chris columbus &amp; 20th cent. fox thought they were making (tho tbf this is the guy who had grems rip off the mom's head in his o.g. gremlins script) where even elements that get shitted on (goofy robocop 3 ending, jake lloyd* sucks, everybody seems like assholes) come off satirical in the cold winter's light</p><p>some occult-reich/fascist synchro with thule-societan arnold as uber/"turbo"-mensch committing multiple assaults (inc. punching a reindeer like the camel in CONAN) while asking if things are "kosher" (!)* &amp; a very weird run of terrorism/bombing refs with W.A.S.T.E.-ian hotep postal worker sinbad praising the unabomber (hartman's character named "ted") before blowing up a radio station full of cops, a violent parade attack pre-programming the boston marathon bombing, and arnold showing up within the first 10 minutes wearing an atlanta 1996 shirt (imdb sez shooting wrapped july 20th, right before eric rudolph's olympic park bombing on july 27th)... hey, you can't bench-press your way outta this one!</p><p>*the excellently-named randy kornfield who wrote EIGHT-LEGGED FREAKS!</p><p>**wish phil got divorced in real life too 😞</p><p>***any rapper sampled jake lloyd saying "purple is really important to me"?? mothmane xmas mix soon</p><p>****<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/03/schwarzenegger.hitler/" rel="nofollow">www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/10/03/schwarzenegger.hitler/</a></p>


<br><b>17: Santa Claus Conquers The Martians</b>
<br><p>sync your breathing to this movie to gain wisdom &amp; insight</p>
<br><b>18: Stigma 1977</b>
<br><p>this is one of those BBC xmas ghost stories like the stone tape &amp; while its maybe less idea-heavy than a nigel kneale script its way more ominous and upsetting, a sharp, painful smother of body/folk-doom with maybe the ultimate 70s uk tv-horror scene, a miserable rural-village mom washing dishes looking out the window at an ancient circle of stones while listening to a radio broadcast about the voyager 1 probe leaving our solar system</p><p>found <a href="https://vimeo.com/33338786" rel="nofollow">[on vimeo]</a> w/ original bbc timecodes &amp; eerie broadcast audio which just adds to the lost-media/surveillance-cam qualities of dread &amp; unease. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/georgia-guidestones/" rel="nofollow">::guidestones</a>-adjacent &amp; highly recommended</p>

<br><b>21: Dark Clouds Over Elberton The True Story Of The Georgia Guidestones</b>
<br><p>for a 2010s conspiradoc about a fixture of lazy right-wing fearmongering (alex jones has like 3 movies on em) this take on the guidestones is shockingly original, thoughtful &amp; well-researched, even if it takes a jesus-y turn towards the end (at least pluralist/not xenophobic about it). could potential "r.c. christian" herbert kersten be related to the gary kirsten that harrassed (atlantan) kerry thornley?? stay tuned. . . </p><p>187-heads may know i grew up near elberton on the s.c. border and my hippie mom dragged me to the guidestones several times as a kid (when i moved to athens me and some weirdos drove out there one night to take mushrooms &amp; watch a meteor shower....) but something you never hear anybody mention about this bizarre, bedrock-esque "granite capital of the world" is its sister city of mure, japan (pop. 18,000, kita district/kagawa prefecture) known for a similar stone (granite!) monument built by sculptor isamu noguchi in 1982, right after the 3/22/80 dedication of georgia's stonehenge:</p><p><a href="https://findshikoku.com/articles/83Ld2" rel="nofollow">findshikoku.com/articles/83Ld2</a></p><p>the ngo/lannan*-funded noguchi has no direct link to the guidestones i can uncover but he tried for decades to build an ultramod rothko(ccf/cia)-style "playscape" outside the U.N. in new york, before finally completing it in 1976 for atlanta's piedmont park, where it remains today:</p><p><a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/stories/why-magazine/the-story-behind-isamu-noguchis-playscapes-in-atlanta/" rel="nofollow">www.hermanmiller.com/stories/why-magazine/the-story-behind-isamu-noguchis-playscapes-in-atlanta/</a></p><p>i have a theory the guidestones were central to making atlanta the new laurel canyon, with "mumble rap" used to hide coded/thelemic/adamic language, mantras &amp; encantations (future: "reprogramming my brain, i was in training," thugger's 3-headed snake, "i was with obama," egypt, pharaohs, medusa, astrology) but thats another review. anyway this is on tubi &amp; pr1me - check it out!</p><p>“Everything is sculpture.

"do what thou wilt" speaks to individual will as the superior principle that magick serves in practice. </p><p>the mystic and the magus both study chaotic patterns of the universe and nourish the ability to spot trends, dismantling pretenses, decoding relationships and predicting future paths, as in conspiracy theory, jungian psychoanalysis, parapolitical investigations etc--like the wave/particle duality of spirits, the polarity of these 2 approaches towards esoteric shit in our shared existence can be seen as an inherent &amp; necessary perspective from which all real gnosis &amp; praxis springs forth: the shaper &amp; the shaped, meteorologists forecasting stormpaths vs. h.a.a.r.p. weather-warlocks performing the ionospheric wifi raindance </p><p>you see this duality in hinduism, the jnani (jnana in sanskrit meaning "knowledge") individualist approach to the spirit world with an attitude of inquiry &amp; doubt, the aggressive wish to penetrate &amp; control the divine, and the bhakti ("participation, fondness, homage, faith, love, devotion, worship") attitude of surrender, trust &amp; acceptance of all the weird, holy shit swirling around us, participating with love to be absorbed whole like novena in catholicism, kavanah in judaism or awgatha in burmese buddhism</p><p>the magus is a scientist, seeing mystery as phenomena to be understood thru a series of experiments with predictable results (tho as greg bishop sez, this stuff is "repeatable, but not on demand"). the mystic, like the priest or shaman, relates to the absolute nature of mystery as a process to join in and eventually surrender to as a conscious sacrifice/destruction of the self</p><p>the mystic approaches ritual-making to engage celebrants in physical, emotional &amp; mental reception to the beyond (catholic high mass, lakota &amp; other indigenous sun dance ceremonies)--energy is generated &amp; assimilated as symbolism in art &amp; cinema.</p><p>ritual magick (chaos rites, golden dawn ceremony, gnostic o.t.o. mass &amp; crowleyism, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/film/the-secret-2006/" rel="nofollow">trump &amp; THE SECRET..</a>) commands spirit forces to evoke the desires of the individual or group "in charge." energy is focused, then directed to a target or goal, like conscious propaganda.</p><p>the occult uses symbols like artists or poets, a language perceiving &amp; communicating in metaphor as a telepathic step above speech &amp; traditional physical action. if telepathy is a step beyond language, what is the step beyond telepathy? the dimension of altered, occultic states of consciousness (drugs, dreams, the grail castle/chapel perilous) all use symbols to communicate &amp; speak their "true" names, which is why mystics, trippers &amp; schizos see numbers, geometric shapes &amp; other symbolic connections while going "beyond"</p><p>these symbols are not yours to control. im not advocating a serene helplessness in meditation, but to turn away from the false confidence of understanding &amp; "need to know." while the mystikal path can just as easily mislead to passive solipsism of past-life regressions, personal mythology, etc (the 'need to be understood') or a smirking deconstructionist pose, the magus 'need to understand' can turn to either self-interested randian thaumaturge or collective anarcho-spiritualist conduit - direct action gets the goods!</p><p>each separate approach encourages development towards us becoming a.. different type of entity, but combine to work towards union with either creator (in theism) or the whole shebang, "the works"- a general universal entirety, serenity, liberation, etc, transcending self, form &amp; ego. obsessive "understanding" (the paranoid child's urge to ask of every story "is this true") creates a cynical psychic shielding, anxiety melting into false certainty &amp; the shaky mirage of invincibility masked by an increasingly callous &amp; jaded shit-talking stance. suffering delusions of confidence, the magus cuts off experiences which may be incongruent to their identity and therefore essential. all the decoding, ranking, puzzle-solving, interpreting, bringing order to chaos you see on here is part of a project to obtain not just objective evidence "from beyond" but in fact only the hard reality of the self.</p>

<br><b>84: Uncle Peckerhead</b>
<br><p>this meandering nicecore splatter comedy needed to be like 20% funnier, weirder and grosser to be really good - its the definition of a "three stars with a heart" movie but im feeling generous today, prob cuz uncle peckerhead himself won me over. def the kinda thing that wins audience appreciation awards at horror cons, for better or worse - a boner gag, occasional goopy gore and dookie/puke spray offset by adorkable geico sitcomedy &amp; stolen simpsons lines (2 in a 30 sec span: "i dont wish you any specific harm" and "i have to go now, my planet needs me") from a trio of polite yet believable punx led by an uptight alyson hannigan type who i think is supposed to be a smoker but since the actress doesnt the only scene where she does is one specifically written into the script. the contrast between these young-millennial gentrifier "umm actually" bohos and the delightful cannibal-demon peckerhead is kinda funny, esp when he (spoilers) performs a flawless peckertality on a metalhead &amp; protests "i was just doing what any friend would do," but this needs something more than charm &amp; a clip from toxic avenger 2 to be really, truly gonzo &amp; not just cute. as a VOD throwback to reheated IDLE HANDS-core its still way better than similar shit like deathgasm &amp; for every underdeveloped detail or bit that doesnt work (i would... love? if these characters could, stop? using interrogative tone? to end every sentence?) theres some shit perfectly written &amp; performed, like the pretentious punker asshole from a band called "dominion rising" that killed me ("i mean, it's just biology"). im not a punk but i guess the tour stuff seems real enough, its refreshingly unconcerned with horror cred, consistency or authenticity, and i cant stress enough how much i love the titular peckerhead, who deserves a gnarlier yet more focused sequel touring with some doomshop soundcloud rappers in like, tampa. in conclusion, watch jenn wexler's THE RANGER!</p>

But their own internal records dating back to the 1970s show that industry officials long knew that recycling plastic on a large scale was unlikely to ever be viable.</p><p>Despite this, three former top officials said the industry promoted recycling as a way to beat back a growing tide of antipathy toward plastic in the 1980s and '90s. The industry was facing initiatives to ban or curb the use of plastic. Recycling, the former officials told NPR and Frontline, became a way to preempt the bans and sell more plastic. "There was never an belief that recycling was going to work in a significant way," says Lew Freeman, former vice president of government affairs for the industry's lobbying group, then called the Society of the Plastics Industry, or SPI. Another top official, Larry Thomas, who led SPI for more than a decade until 2000, says the strategy to push recycling was simple:</p><p>"The feeling was the plastics industry was under fire, we got to do what it takes to take the heat off, because we want to continue to make plastic products," Thomas says. "If the public thinks the recycling is working, then they're not going to be as concerned about the environment."</p></blockquote><p>"blue bin" trash get landfilled or burned &amp; china, the only real market for u.s. recyclables, stopped buying years ago - our product is too contaminated. the closest thing this special gets to a non-consumer solution is robin williams telling us to "vote with our hearts" (??) cool, that'll deindustrialize the apocalypse! im not saying just give up &amp; keep buying stupid shit (the mantra of every amazon-addicted "no ethical consumption under capitalism" marxist): direct action, sabotage, (organized) boycotts, food not bombs, community barter programs, even a 50,000 vote shift in national elections (sigh) has 10000x the impact of every doomed pro-tip in this molochian propaganda. the 1990 earth day special's self-congratulatory amalgam of capitalist promo &amp; flashy, ostentatious hippie posturing reflects the movement itself, embodied by earth day's (disputed) co-founder, a "free-floating rasputin to power brokers and opinion makers": ira einhorn</p><p><a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/obituaries/07Einhorn1/07Einhorn1-superJumbo.jpg" rel="nofollow">static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/obituaries/07Einhorn1/07Einhorn1-superJumbo.jpg</a></p><p>who was ira einhorn? he's everything &amp; nothing, guru, con-artist, 'planetary enzyme,' false idol, murderer. the "unicorn killer" (einhorn = one horn) died 2 weeks ago in the philly prison he'd been locked in for 18 years, serving life without parole for the 1977 murder of girlfriend holly maddux, finally convicted in absentia &amp; extradited from his hideout in france's charente region (home of templars &amp; joseph-ignace guillotin) in 2001. he maintained his innocence til the end.</p><p>&gt;&gt;THEORIES OF EINHORN'S GUILT, ranked:</p><p>::5. the CIA scapegoated a humble activist for truth-telling heroism (his story)</p><p>ironically most times you hear about ira einhorn its right-wing media trying to shame us eco-nerds with a story that actually mostly supports his version of events (except the murdering) - to them hes a "widely-respected" socialist mastermind hugely important to the american left, solely responsible for inventing earth day (as tribute to lenin!), who "composted" his girlfriend cuz lol enviromentalism. limbaugh recites this every april to deny climate change &amp; misdirect about who's the "real misogynists" (last year i saw a #metoo hypocrisy bent to this stuff) but aside from the guilt &amp; frame-up, it's all ira's own myth, and theirs - isnt "brave, combative, anti-establishment iconoclast framed by deep state elites for assaulting women" the right's take on trump? ira just picked the wrong cause! as reagan secretary of the interior james watt said in 1991, "if the troubles from environmentalists cannot be solved in the jury box or at the ballot box, the cartridge box should be used."*</p><p>using the unicorn as an excuse for hippie-punching ignores how much of the actual left hated &amp; distrusted him, especially his ties to corporate capital &amp; military/intelligence sociopaths. the guy who ""joked"" he was part of an "international conspiracy" to make the planet livable was far from humble, hardworking or grassroots - while ira claimed he dreamt up "the largest secular holiday on the planet" actual earth day organizers say they brought him in as a media-savvy puppet to shore up establishment support (which, granted, is what i'd say if a murderer co-founded my event). </p><p>student activist austan librach said the plan was "he would get exposure, and to the world it would look like he was (the) M.C., the guy in charge." ira's contribution as the most visible figure of this nationally televised event seems to have been mostly dancing around in love beads &amp; pranking (kissing??) FBI-opposing senator ed muskie, later the target of similar "dirty tricks" from nixon. of course, this meaningless merry-prankster bullshit never targeted the CFOs writing him checks. "he knew enough corporate people to get our projects funded simply by strolling into people's offices and asking for the money." said sun oil co exec george keegan, who ran mysterious "neighborhood projects" with einhorn for years. </p><p>one of ira's biggest bankrolls was the vice-chairman of AT&amp;T, bill cashel: an early proponent of "computer conferencing" (think about that on yr next zoom meeting), the unicorn's weekly dispatches to over 300 individuals &amp; orgs across 26 countries were funded entirely by AT&amp;T, a relationship they hoped would help them to tap into the new "information superhighway" (-sen. al gore, 1978) on the pentagon's ARPAnet. the judge at ira's hearing was baffled by the relationship, especially when told "no money ever changed hands". how did ira live &amp; travel the globe without a job? while on the run, einhorn claimed he was a "ceremonial scapegoat" in an intra-CIA war between two factions of the agency, and future director george tenet told him he was "one of his". was ira CIA?</p><p>the intro to steven levy's indispensable "the unicorn's secret" (source for most quotes, unless noted) places ira einhorn in close contact with "Uri Geller, the Shah, the family who owned Seagram liquors, the vice-president of AT&amp;T, top NASA officials, Timothy Leary, Krishnamurti, the Trilateral Commission—a dazzling display of names and institutions." other passages note partnerships with lockheed, bell labs, the h.w. bush-connected lehman brothers, est cult founder werner erhard, arthur c. clarke, futurist alvin toffler, astronauts buzz aldrin &amp; edgar mitchell, and as an aide to NC congressman charlie rose of the house committee for intelligence, who confirmed einhorn's involvement in national security operations. levy's book describes one of ira's consultations with dr. ross speck's "london group":</p><blockquote><p>"The name-dropping built to a crescendo when Ira Einhorn mentioned that "I was very surprised recently when I was approached by the Rockefellers and offered whatever amount of money I wanted to run for public office." When a woman pointedly asked just why the Rockefellers would ask this guru-with-portfolio to do a thing like that, Ira was undaunted.</p><p>"They need a front," he said. "Very badly. They’re constantly hunting for people." Their efforts previously had been confined to more conventional potential candidates, he claimed. "It’s not succeeding!" he said. "That’s why they’re looking other places. That’s why they would come to some crazy like myself." A Rockefeller aide approached Einhorn at a party and, said Ira, "gave me this incredible harangue how I had to go eat rubber chicken all over the country and really become a politician and get out front." Einhorn declined gracefully. "I had already been through that process, and I felt I had a lot more power doing what I was doing.</p></blockquote><p>as one of the yippie "five marx brothers" alongside abbie hoffman, jerry rubin, woodstock artist marty carey &amp; conspiracist/mae brussell-publisher paul krassner, ira was known for ducking out of protests &amp; direct action, preferring to lunch with right-wing colonels and PR guys from telecoms, leading to suspicions in the movement he was an informant, infiltrator, or worse. marty, his wife sue and E.T.-actor peter coyote (einhorn met spielberg at coppola's house in 1975) once spent "hours" in a cabin grilling ira on his international connections and funding by AT&amp;T, ultimately finding him so evasive they left "wondering if he was a CIA agent run amok".</p><p>einhorn himself was famously conspiratorial (he pushed his own jfk-CIA theories), but after accusing the agency of murdering his lover never bothered to fake outrage or work to hold the "real killers" responsible, and had no objection to being represented in court by warren report author &amp; future republican senator arlen "single bullet" specter (!!), who secured a ridiculously low $4000 bail (ironically, since specter "convicted" oswald "in absentia" with the report).</p><p>that $4000 bail was paid by canadian billionaires charles &amp; barbara bronfman, heirs to the seagram's fortune. real ZOLAR* heads will remember the bronfman fam for their recent sex trafficking for the einhorn-esque cult NXIVM (or their ties to jfk assassination figure clay shaw) but at the time of this 20th anniversary earth day special the bronfmans owned not only 25% of dupont but, thru their purchase of MCA, universal studios, who provided the backlot filming location &amp; several assets hyped &amp; promoted here, including christopher lloyd hopping out the delorean as doc brown - a character bob gale says was inspired by einhorn confidant jack sarfatti.</p><p>ira's circle kept rubbing up against hollywood for good reason - while hoffman and the yippies took protest ideas from the world of advertising, the unicorn seemed interested in branding &amp; marketing with no apparent meaning beyond itself. in the months before his arrest, ABC was negotiating with ira to create a youth-oriented late night show to compete with saturday night live. a sun ra bio describes his attempts to avoid einhorn clout-chasing him around 70s philly's new age/ufo scene, dramatized by sinister mib-esque spooks in "space in the place". in a weird "coincidental" detail, the day the cops finally came to arrest ira was less than 24 hours after the three mile island nuclear disaster, which got "pushed off the headlines" by the arrest (the 3/29/79 front page of the philadelphia daily news supports this - "nuclear accident: radiation spreads" is dwarfed by "HIPPIE GURU HELD IN TRUNK SLAYING"). this meltdown was predicted/prefigured in a movie released only 12 days before, "the china syndrome", which the anti-nuke einhorn saw &amp; enjoyed, predicting an oscar win for jack lemmon (one of the stars of the 1990 ABC earth day special). anybody know the odds for one of the best-known nuke opponents/alt-energy/solar power advocates getting busted for murder hours after the worst nuclear disaster in u.s. history?</p><p>one more hollywood connection: naomi watts played holly maddux in the NBC true crime tv movie "hunt for the unicorn killer" which aired may 9th, 1999, just months after she filmed a 90 minute tv pilot for david lynch called - of course - mulholland drive. transcendental meditationist lynch spent the late 60s in philadelphia as a film student, running in the same academic/new age/community theater circles as einhorn  (“It wasn’t a normal city when I was here,” Lynch recalled. “The fear, insanity, corruption, filth, despair, violence in the air was so beautiful to me. Philadelphia is percolating in me”). the upstairs apartment that inspired eraserhead is just a 1.2 mile walk thru the philly museum of art campus to einhorn's infamous pad &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p><p>david lynch's house: 2429 Aspen St, Philadelphia, PA, 19130</p><p>ira einhorn's apartment: 3411 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104</p><p>...where holly maddux's corpse was described by police as found "wrapped in plastic"</p><p>::4. einhorn was framed by the KGB for his work in psychic warfare, tesla technology &amp; mind control</p><p>how did this 'marxist-leninist pacifist' end up working for the pentagon on domestic weapons development with an anti-soviet colonel, one of the only friends who stood by him til the end? was he ambushed by the commies for loving america TOO MUCH???</p><p>this theory is mentioned by right-wing physicist/transhumanist/"race to witch mountain" ufologist-cameo* jack sarfatti, another close friend of einhorn (ira was his agent!), in an newsgroup msg from 2001:</p><blockquote><p>From: "Dr. Jack Sarfatti"<br/>Sent: Saturday, March 31, 2001 2:10 PM<br/>Subject: Re: The Einhorn Affair</p><p>Thanks re: rumor from Dick Farley that President Bush is about to intervene in the Einhorn Affair. Note that Senator Arlen Specter was Ira's original defense attorney and that Ira claims he was framed because of his work with Colonel Tom Bearden and others on alleged Soviet psychotronic "hyperspace weapons" and "UFOs" around the Uri Geller situation that was very much in the limelight in the mid-70's when CIA, DIA etc. was funding paranormal remote viewing research that Ira, working with Jacques Vallee, Arthur Young, Andrija Puharich, Sir John Whitmore, Joyce Petchek, Brendan O Regan, Esalen's Michael Murphy and others was very much in the thick of at the time. Einhorn was also deeply involved in Serbian affairs around the Tesla Archive in Beograd, and the nephew of the Shah of Iran. He was also the book agent for "Space Time and Beyond" that I coauthored with Fred Alan Wolf and Bob Toben dedicated to Carlo Suares in Paris. The Plot thickens.</p></blockquote><p>sarfatti might just be throwing crap at the wall - he also names philly mayor frank rizzo, a fascist ex-cop who once said of a police brutality protest "When I'm finished with them, I'll make Attila the Hun look like a faggot," suggesting maddux's killers could've been "Mafioso Mayor Frank Rizzo and his corrupt DA and police homocide goons Central American style Death Squads." (in 1978 rizzo sent his goons to evict MOVE from their powelton village home literally across the street from einhorn, who had no involvement with the group even as they protested three mile island). in another now-deleted 1999 usenet msg, a user named "CZar Fatt I" posted:</p><blockquote><p>: "Ira told me directly that he had been framed by the KGB not<br/>: the CIA. Hank Harrison, Courtney Love's father, told me<br/>: directly that he thinks Ira is guilty of maybe more than one<br/>: murder. Hank said Ira was under CIA protection in Dublin.<br/>: This is all hearsay and I do not know what is true. I do<br/>: know that Congressman Charlie Rose then of the House Select<br/>: Committee on Intelligence told me in a phone conversation<br/>: that Ira was working with him. So it makes no sense that<br/>: the CIA would frame Ira since he was working for them."</p></blockquote><p>what we do know is sometime in the 70s einhorn phoned up jack sarfatti and told him he'd secured funding from AT&amp;T, the bronfmans, and NC congressman charlie rose to link up "visionary scientists" and fight soviet ESP warfare with what he called his "psychic mafia" (sarfatti got so many weird calls im surprised he didnt hear from indrid cold!!). congressman rose was already an advocate for the pentagon's paranormal research: "Some people think this is the work of the Devil," he said, "other people think it's the work of the Holy Spirit," especially concerned with fighting "Soviet breakthroughs in psychotronic weapons of mind control at a distance using ELF and sound waves." </p><p>in 1978, ufologist jacques vallee wrote in his journal:</p><blockquote><p>"Boston. Tuesday 14 November 1978: Last night I gave an informal lecture at the home of some friends of Ira, who spends a few months as a Visiting Fellow at the Harvard Institute of International Politics. The house belonged to Gunther Weil and the audience included Izhtak Bentov who specializes in psychic medicine, and his Russian-born wife who seems to be one of Ira's sources about Soviet research. Ira took me aside: the CIA had sent a man to see him, a former scientific director at IBM who asked what he knew about the Soviet interest in Tesla's work. This man now serves as coordinator of advanced projects at the Pentagon.</p></blockquote><p>einhorn assembled a study group he promised could "meet the soviet threat," recruiting pentagon analyst lt. colonel thomas e. bearden, who'd presented at einhorn's "mind over matter" conference in january of 1977 along with 'secret life of plants' author christopher bird and andrija puharich (more on him soon). colonel bearden, who later put his tesla/free-energy crank theories to work in bush's department of energy after 9/11, had been working with einhorn at the esalen institution in california, a new age "human potential center" based out of big sur that attracted scientologists, intelligence assets, and convicted killer charles manson*, who visited just days before the tate murders.* </p><p>einhorn's mentor puharich had just discovered israeli psychic uri geller &amp; brought him to the u.s. for telepathy experiments at esalen, princeton's institute for advanced study, the institute of noetic sciences, and the stanford research institute - einhorn claims he told puharich to write the book "URI" &amp; spent "every waking moment of six years" promoting what he referred to as "the geller project". by the 70s the SRI was the hub for CIA ESP, as laid out in jim schnabel's "remote viewers: the secret history of america's psychic spies":</p><blockquote><p>"...the CIA's psi research had been conducted since 1972 at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), a big science thank-tank in Menlo Park, California. SRI researchers, after experimenting with various psi phenomena, had decided to concentrate on clairvoyance - the psychic 'seeing' of things otherwise hidden by obstacles or distance -for use in espionage. The SRI researchers, in rivalry with their Soviet counterparts, were attempting nothing less than the development of the perfect spies, human beings who, undetectably and at almost zero cost, could spy upon the most remote, sensitive, and heavily guarded locations. Throwing out the old labels for psychic phenomena, the SRI scientists were calling their clairvoyant techniques 'remote viewing.'"</p></blockquote><p>at the same time, esalen was establishing a "soviet exchange program" to share intel with u.s.-curious russian politicians &amp; academics, many of whom ended up in yeltsin &amp; gorbachev's inner circles during the end of the cold war. some of gorbachev's closest advisors sat in esalen hot tubs &amp; mineral baths with einhorn, puharich &amp; rose discussing how to dismantle the USSR, before heading off to sensory deprivation tanks or channeling the extraterrestrial"council of nine".*</p><p>(hollywood links continue with one of the "nine" crew being star trek's gene roddenberry, detailed in comments here: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/film/race-to-witch-mountain/#comment-5405673" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/film/race-to-witch-mountain/#comment-5405673</a> while another of the psychic mafia, rocket scientist george koopman, is credited as "(special operations: Chicago)" for the blues brothers, where his tales about SRI "psi busters" inspired dan aykroyd - who, yes, cameos in the 1990 earth day special, alongside harold ramis as "elon spengler" - to write ghostbusters, before dying in a car crash in 1989 at age 44.)</p><p>same time as their friendly moscow exchanges, col. bearden was calling for a "new manhattan project" to create super-nukes that could penetrate soviet "tesla shield" defenses, based on ira's research. einhorn had spent years studying papers the FBI seized after tesla's death in new york, which feds immediately classified after calling in national defense research committee/MIT expert john g. trump (uncle of ira's fellow abuser donald)(!) to "analyze" &amp; underplay their military value. ira gave the keynote speech at a may 1977 symposium at harvard called "towards a physics of consciousness" insisting russia was far ahead of the u.s. in psychic warfare and "we have to catch up". later that year, in stewart brand's magazine 'coevolution quarterly', he wrote that the soviets had found a way to build tesla's "magnifying transmitter" called "the woodpecker" which could send ELF beams to cause blackouts, disrupt radio broadcasts, influence weather events, and target alpha brainwave frequencies for mind control. right before his exile, ira was running around telling anyone who'd listen how tesla research was the key to defeating the USSR, info bearden used in his hawkish CIA paper "STAR WARS NOW!

<div><blockquote><p>"it always works, it works every time, with every person"</p></blockquote><p>"why do you think that 1 percent of the population makes 96% of the money earned? you think thats an accident?" - bob proctor ('philosopher') quoting author rhonda byrne in THE SECRET, a consumerist commodification of metaphysics that literally frames the universe as a "catalog" you can "order products" (experiences) from thru targeted wishing (manifestation). i dont even disagree with the basic premise of this ("thoughts equal things") but the reduction of everything weird/metaphysical into fulfilling yr basest emotional &amp; capitalist cravings turns my stomach</p><p>with #savethechildren q-drops spreading thru yoga groups like ayurvedic wildfire its important to remember in 2007 donald trump was making top-billed video appearances at new age "wealth beyond reason" conferences promoted on thesecret.tv by guys from the 'law of attraction' movement like lee brower and quoted approvingly by future rivals marianne williamson &amp; deepak chopra til mid-2011 when the birther stuff &amp; bin laden's headshot turned em around (just like you can find not-that-old nbc ads w/ tina fey &amp; the parks &amp; rec gang holding hands singing showtunes with their good bud from the apprentice) </p><p>the big dumb president's affinity for positive thinking &amp; other irrational shit that libs mock (like his belief that exercise depletes lifeforce*) springs from an unbreakable psychic confidence in his own alchemical reality-bending abilities conjured thru centuries of objectivist-individualist sorcery built to eradicate aryan self-doubt - real, serious ideas from sage, scholarly creeps that only get discussed 'n dismissed by teachers-pet factcheckers &amp; agnostic journos/pundits reducing him to merely superstitious like a snake-handler rube, busy trying to voxplain the paycheck anxiety of meth-belt gargoyles &amp; manifesto'd mosque shooters with pagan decals on their backpacks instead of truly understanding the postmodern occult philosophies gaining massive power internationally </p><p>calling trump a cult or cult-leader is a thought-terminating cliche--i think of him more like a charismatic guru or shaman, a 3rd-eye philosopher-autocrat creature born from the intimate relationship between ugly strains of the new thought/human potential movement, 80s multi-level marketing &amp; u.s. intelligence ops, amerikkkan ethno-mercantilism, prosperity pentecosts like paula white/jim bakker/pat robertson (the 700 club 'law of reciprocity'), O.T.O./A∴A∴ &amp; thelemic mysticism, cold war mind control experiments and his fuckbuddy epstein's transhumanist flavor of demonic hermeneutics &amp; mortality-terror. what we know as "trump" exists in the realm of archetypes, thoughtforms &amp; egregores' omnipresent daily manifestations &amp; crowley's "science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will"</p><p>the grand-lodge narrative of reality-warping positivism that gives donald's life its meaning &amp; nourishes endless "tired of winning" triumphs is his personal hermetic doctrine &amp; perspective as an individual - i.e. shit pleases or annoys him - mediated thru the spectacle of machines &amp; machine-type experiences like his rallies, twitter and reality tv. the obsessive fox news-watching that everybody clowns (8-12 hrs a day!) demonstrates his intense focus on viral hypersigils in a trance state to increase the power of useful media thoughtforms ("falsehoods," per pedantic libs) to break free &amp; influence objective shared reality. the native tongue of our collective subconscious is the use &amp; manipulation of symbols, &amp; trump's 24-hr dominance of amerika's psyche (everyone against him defined as only not-him) comes from how his symbols forcibly worm their way into harmonic order with less resistance than normal words or ideas, like swarms of beautiful boaters reforging norse conqueror masks into punisher skulls rendered black and blue with teased-up amber sheafs of trumphair. </p><p>don's post-irony "nothing is true, everything is permitted" ethos baffles square/agnostic media to the real darkness beyond his obv evils of authoritarian xenophobia, brutalizing the poor, etc, his coordinated synchromysticism with 8kun &amp; the chans on a techno-astral plane forcing willful thoughts &amp; nightmares into "wins" of bone-solid slabs thru universal smartphone connectivity &amp; mass-directed focus &amp; intent</p><p>its clear from his books, his speeches, his interviews, everything youve ever seen him do, that trump believes this, that he knows his weird thoughts form literal energy fields which vibrate on nauseating frequencies to extract sick pleasures &amp; desires from the magacosm in some vague application of sperm-ritual quantum invocation, the broken many worlds hypothesis or copenhagen/dirac-von neumann shit (wave-particle duality etc). im not saying trump knows exactly what this is called (even the alt-right guys dont actually READ evola) but his terrifying success was erected on a pile of books by biz gurus &amp; demagogues of pop spirituality, self-improvement wealth-wizards who studied the real, dark power of "positive thinking" beyond normies making 'vision boards' or silicon valley's epic warren buffet meme guys, strangling the hobgoblins of new thought in the tradition of ralph waldo emerson &amp; william james (a fake q-drop implies trump's unreleased transcripts show he studied crowley, neville goddard, savitra devi &amp; alan watts in college, lol) into a 21st century goulash of theosophy, stage magic, prosperity gospel, l. ron hubbardism, psycho-cybernetics (less interesting than it sounds) &amp; randian skyscraper kitsch. yknow manson studied dale carnegie, right?</p><p>so its been weird spending the last 5 years on here becoming known for unmasking lib celebs like hanks or nora ephron, as if the director of youve got mail doing propaganda in the 90s is really our biggest problem when (to misquote biden) nora ephron is dead and donald trump is alive, but ive had no idea how to tackle all that til right now when its finally starting to look like his luck has run out</p><p>his luck? what trump calls "lucky breaks" are what jungian mages &amp; new thought philosophers call "synchonicities" and what practitioners of chaos magic call 'increasing odds of outcomes' - how else do you explain this asshole's ability to get everything he wants? who else can get away with hundreds - thousands - of crimes, scams &amp; juugs that would individually ruin anyone else in biz &amp; politics? how did an obese, enraged 73 yr old working one of the highest-stress jobs on the planet recover from covid so quickly &amp; thoroughly that within the week he was bellowing his way across 5 states a day??? reiki energy healing? maybe he cant manifest a babalon-working moonchild from his cum but can undo reality just enough to push someone born rich, white and male over the finish line over &amp; over again - theres no rift between perception &amp; actual objects to him; whatever he has, its more than enough to overrule wicca-phase hobbyist binding spells or any moon-hex from teal-dyed WitchTok ezoomers ("so mote it be!")</p><p>if thats true, why is he losing?

Rumely, a spy and agitator for Germany during both World Wars. Like many others, Rumely, too, benefited from his association with Hitler benefactor Henry Ford. {Another of Rumely’s fellow travelers in the Fifth Column movement was Frank Gannett, founder of the newspaper chain that bears his name.) "Rumely is boss of the Committee for Constitutional Government and second in command to Frank E. Gannett, publisher of a string of newspapers and founder of the committee in 1937. As soon as the Senatorial investigation was over, Rumely literally went underground and erased his name from the Committee stationery. But he continued to run it by appointing a docile Protestant clergyman as ‘acting chairman and secretary’ who visited the office only occasionally. He was the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale, once a joint speaker with American fascist Mrs. Elizabeth Dilling and the Reverend Edward Lodge Curran key aide to Father Coughlin at a ‘pro-American mass meeting sponsored by more than 50 patriotic organizations’ at the Hotel Commodore in New York. Rumely’s friendship with Henry Ford dated prior to the summer of 1918 when Ford rushed to Washington in an unsuccessful attempt to save Rumely from being indicted. </p><p>When evaluating the significance of the Fifth Column for contemporary Americans, it is important to remember that there was no de-Nazification process for the United States after the war. The Nazi conspirators in this country not only went untouched, many of them became prominent, or continued in positions of prominence. In addition, some of the most heinous Third Reich alumni were imported into this country under the auspices of the Gehlen spy organization, Project Paperclip and the Crusade For Freedom, where they joined their domestic American partners in corrupting postwar American politics. Noting the rise of the reactionary Christian forces in this country, one must wonder if they are heirs to Father Coughlin and his ilk.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://religionnews.com/2019/04/08/its-norman-vincent-peales-america/" rel="nofollow">religionnews.com/2019/04/08/its-norman-vincent-peales-america/</a></p><p>peale pioneered a sort of dark horse quasi-christian osteenian selfish gospel that the holy spirit will anoint you with spiritual gifts if you have enough faith, not in god but yourself, to "name it and claim it" (thats the secret!) the shift of individualism from toqueville's "self interest properly understood" to the church of satan's randian objectivism (“If I show up at a [New Thought church] I am there for one reason and one reason only — the advancement of my personal awareness.

The patients are able to give only vague hints of its construction. It consists of boxes, cranks, levers, wheels, buttons, wires, batteries, and the like. Patients endeavor to discover the construction of the apparatus by means of their technical knowledge, and it appears that with the progressive popularization of the sciences, all the forces known to technology are utilized to explain the functioning of the apparatus. All the discoveries of mankind, however, are regarded as inadequate to explain the marvelous powers of this machine, by which the patients feel themselves persecuted. The main effects of the influencing machine are the following: It makes the patient see pictures. When this is the case, the machine is generally a magic lantern or cinematograph. The pictures are seen on a single plane, on walls or windowpanes, and unlike typical visual hallucinations are not three-dimensional. It produces, as well as removes, thoughts and feelings by means of waves or rays or mysterious forces which the patient's knowledge of physics is inadequate to explain. In such cases, the machine is often called a "suggestion-apparatus." Its construction cannot be explained, but its function consists in the transmission or "draining off" of thoughts and feelings by one or several persecutors. It produces motor phenomena in the body, erections and seminal emissions, that are intended to deprive the patient of his male potency and weaken him. This is accomplished either by means of suggestion or by air-currents, electricity, magnetism, or X-rays. It creates sensations that in part cannot be described, because they are strange to the patient himself, and that in part are sensed as electrical, magnetic, or due to air-currents. It is also responsible for other occurrences in the patient's body, such as cutaneous eruptions, abscesses, or other pathological processes.

<br><p>i watched this so much as a kid i know the rating seems low so lemme get the good stuff out the way: isabella rossellini, the opening 'songbird' number, dean cundeys photography &amp; legit great meryl line-readings ("NOW a warning?!?!") of the superficially clever script by david koepp (JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT) thats like a hollywood megabudget version of a 70s underground bad taste/counterculture comedy(paul morrissey or paul bartel, but straight) with a generally good rep earned more from nostalgia &amp; catty tumblr gifs than actually working as a comedy or horror movie. heres the thing - lines like "divorce? in california?!" arent actually jokes and only sound like it if youre like 8 or leno-level corny. boy i thought that was some sophisticated shit as a kid tho! it was sposed to be a tales from a crypt movie but lacks the loser grime of DEMON NIGHT or other would-be crypts (frighteners, dusk til dawn) with its rich-ppl luxury mansion cocktail party shit, which combined with the bloated/overdirected blockbuster style of robert "2 years from gump" zemeckis' weird tech obsessions and corny celebrity/alt-history "easter eggs" (woahh its elvis &amp; jim morrison!!) leaves whats essentially a bloodless splatstick zombie-com stuck using low-poly t-1000 c.g., v light makeup (apparently being dead turns goldie hawn into meg foster) &amp; 90s bluescreen for its body horror/flesh-melt "gore gags" (if u can call em that) done better three years earlier in SOCIETY on 1/100th the budget. imagine doing a lame pg13 take on this kinda stuff, the same year as dead alive/braindead! also rips off corman's LEECH WOMAN, carrying on the 80s trend of smug hollywood assholes treating corman cheapies as artless grist for shallow camp-lite product, all wrapped up in an overly cutesy alan silvestri score.</p><p>i do like the scene where goldie blames both men &amp; women in general for her break-up depending on who shes talking to (even if its kinda just she-devil) but overall the story of a humble loser nice-guy who understandably pushes his bitch wife down the stairs cuz she goofed on his peebus &amp; he ends up passive-aggressively outclassing these 2 vain, man-hating sluts by living a full, fertile trad-con life while theyre dried-up old maids reliant on - gasp - each other instead of landing husbands leaves all the bitchy slayyy-honey one-liners with a dumb sitcom chuck lorre feel &amp; while i admit e.c. comix could be reactionary i think even in the 50s william gaines would've had the evil, immortal queen b outfox a simpering schlub like this. meryl &amp; goldie eat their roles up enough to slide into its place as a drag diva classic but i cant help that id find this material suspect even from somebody like almodovar much less the writer of MORTDECAI &amp; director who gave jenny AIDS in forrest gump</p>

<br><p>every time this took another bizarre, alienating tonal shift id remind myself "director of SHRUNKEN HEADS" like that explained it somehow. the script by full mooner matthew bright (dark angel, freeway 1/2) is actually real creative &amp; kind of touching in parts (tho he still cant put 2 women in a scene without them making out) but elfman's direction just lets him down constantly &amp; ideas like van helsing as an antisemite who did mengelesque experiments during ww2 or vampires fangboning w/ psychic blood &amp; shared memories belong in a less stupid movie than this one. van helsing's temp assistant starts out as a legit funny riff on the winston zeddemore "what if a regular guy hunted monsters for a paycheck" but quickly becomes next level racist when all the homies come thru &amp; only almost worth it to see (spoilers) a half-dozen vampire crips run a AIDS-metaphor gangbang train nut in shriveled rick baker bat-monster kim cattrall (o_o) and an excuse for track placement of nyc's beatnuts (which l.a. crips would never listen to) &amp; flint, michigan's underrated dayton family, plus a credit for some chapter 2: world domination-era three 6 mafia i didnt catch in the movie itself ["spill my blood," which ended last yr's mixx: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-982273127/damyen-tha-wikkid-murdda-chylde-x-veggietales-halloween-mix-2019-safe-spooky-fun" rel="nofollow">soundcloud.com/user-982273127/damyen-tha-wikkid-murdda-chylde-x-veggietales-halloween-mix-2019-safe-spooky-fun</a> </p><p>the oddball (undirected) cast is a mixed bag: oscar-winner steiger is trying, natalie wood's kid is ok, doing a kinda holly body/nancy allen/natasha lyonne (who cameos) type (question; howd she have tanlines?) but only craig "a$ap" ferguson seems to actually get what kinda movie this is while the normally-great cattrall seems confused, casper v.d. (exec producer!!) suxx (as always) and the guy from murphy brown is maybe the worst onscreen drac ive ever seen - with udo kier in the cast who makes the guy from murphy brown yr dracula??!! which a year later led to him allegedly murdering his gf before fatally o.d.ing on morphine in 2004. despite that a good chunk of this actually works (extra star for UDO!) if watched w/ a combo of krusty's worker&amp;parasite "what the hell was that??" face and the kid in addams family values who says "i'll never forget you...youre too weird"</p>

In the early 1980s (probably '81 or '82), Kennedy got a call from a guy who was living in Spielberg's childhood home on Lookout Mountain outside Phoenix and had discovered the 8mm films Spielberg had made as a child. Kennedy had just read a story in the LA Times about how two teens (Abrams and Reeves) had won a young filmmaker award. "I said to Steven," Kennedy recalled to Vanity Fair. "You know what would be really great? Why don't you hire these two kids who just won this film award, who would probably give anything to meet you, and they could clean up your movies and transfer them to tape so that we never run the risk of these movies disappearing again?"

Much of the work, including iconic elements such as the lightsabers (Van Der Veer Photo Effects), the aura around deceased Jedi (Lookout Mountain Films) and the blueprints of the Death Star (Larry Cuba), was farmed out to contractors. These outside vendors brought a great deal of creativity and innovation to the movies.

<br><b>160: Crimes And Mister Meanors</b>
<br><p>strapped in for a christian uncle buck ripoff and got a patriotic, faith-based timecop thriller instead. all you need to know about everything weird about this is its 2015: year se7en of the obama presidency so wholesome family fun has a libertarian fuck-em approach to the feds and a (spoilers) evil, power-hungry villainess who absolutely will murder children to become the "first female president" by erasing george washington from herstory!!! cuz of that seething fixation/bias they fuck up a perfectly good wacky uncle detective premise which couldve been charming into increasingly grim, unfun action &amp; watered-down clancy conspiracizing thats hard to imagine any actual kid enjoying - if theyre old enough theyll just wanna watch a real movie - but maybe a 6th grade christian history teacher will make em watch it (mine showed the class jerry falwell's CLINTON KILL LIST vhs) on account of the patriotic tea party/1776 shit coded back then as anti-obama, which feels handed off from post 9/11 anti-bush constitution-fetishizing (anti-clinton popcult was more focused on his hippy/hillbilly lack of masculinity than tricornered flag-humping, as seen in ID4, air force one, etc) and ended up reskinned for the trump era as mister-president-sir hamiltoncore w/ general "niceness" plugged in too (mr rogers, bob ross, etc). none of that has anything to do with this movie except how funny/odd it is to see the twilight's last gleaming of faux-radical thomas paine death-to-tyrants amerikitsch before a hard reboot back to cheney-era protester-punching glee (tfw obummer comes for yr bitcoin). nobody was asking for national treasure lite with an irritating christian nationalist tween in a freddy krueger cardigan spouting manifest destiny &amp; misquoting lloyd bentsen but i gotta respect an atlanta/milledgeville production (2nd unit shot in DC) showcasing players from GET OUT, too many cooks, nicotero's walking dead &amp; various tyler perry stage productions, with which it shares the iron cross-looking dove faith family seal of approval despite "Men with machine guns; young man picks lock on hospital door; teenagers chased, caught and handcuffed; woman points gun at kids; guys with guns; man threatens to shoot girl; shots fired at boy; woman holds boy at gun point" etc. </p><p>anyway why is it not TIMES and mister meanors????????</p>

<br><b>165: Scooby Doo On Zombie Island</b>
<br><p>the scoobert gang spend 1998 in new orleans and not once do they listen to silkk the shocker featuring mystikal's "it aint my fault"??? </p><p>i remember cartoon network hyping their 10/31/98 tv premiere of this but i guess back then i figured id outgrown scooby doo &amp; watching it now i think i was right. actually thats wrong, it outgrew me - this may be the dorkiest opinion ive ever held on here but even w/ some cool fulci gags &amp; lewton mood this movie's introduction of actual ghosts n goblins into the 'dooniverse fucks it up beyond redeem. obv in most fiction (&amp; real life!) i welcome the intrusion of the supernatural/ultraterrestrial, but scooby doo isnt some potteresque fantasy about teens fighting magical monsters, its a blueprint for young conspiracy theorists on how to approach the terrifying (but real) deceivers of our world.</p><p>"conspiracy theory" gets a bad rap nowadays (anybody notice the pluto tv conspiracy channel is now "the paranormal channel"?) but to me its a critical/analytical process for learning things outside established systems narratives, a way to challenge &amp; ultimately dismantle psychological warfare often waged by those who actually get called "conspiracy theorists" exploiting metaphysical truths beyond our understanding to 'mask' their petty cons, abuses, exploitations &amp; financial crimes with enigmatic spectacles of cultural fear &amp; superstition (or superstition's cousin, ideology)</p><p>scooby doo reverses this duped q/conspiracy-theorist-as-slur mindset: big business isnt a front for creepy satanic rituals, ritual activity is a front for the mundane evils of business. old man jenkins doesnt need to believe in witch doctors any more than peter thiel needs to believe in bloodmoons or #q-sigils, they just need you to believe. powerful exploiters &amp; molesters use lurid, sensationalist grand guignol kitsch like mantis abductions or p1zzagate to scare us away from uncovering the next denny hastert (or ICE abuse), redirecting outrage from the blandly affluent to spectral weirdos, artists &amp; queers - it's a bank president in a monster mask. </p><p>true to its beatnik/countercultural roots, every classic episode of the show follows the stages of this follow-the-money demystification process. im cribbing some of this from a long-deleted occult research blogspot but details like the gang's trippy texas-chainsaw van the "MYSTERY MACHINE" give it away: "mysteries"="machines," made up of elements that can be taken apart &amp; broken down to understand thru analysis. when facing a situation that seems esoteric &amp; incomprehensible, you can apply the scooby doo lens to view the evil mechanistically - its not supernatural, its moral, political &amp; economic (not ghosts, machines). obv this trick cant be the final word on everything (evil is real, "ghosts" are real) but for kids id like to keep it as clean &amp; usable a tool as possible, and forcing mystic demons into the cartoon nullifies that (on purpose?)</p><p>in a weird way scooby doo is like a kid's first mcluhanite media-literacy tool, one of mae brussell's filing cabinets of articles cross ref'd to the warren report (w/the oswald rifle pic the CIA's version of a swamp witch get-up). turns out a lot of "news" treated as wacky, irrational, mystifying or impossible-to-understand is just crime! if we learn how to break it down &amp; identify this, we can keep it from manipulating us &amp; break the fear/consumption cycle represented by shaggy &amp; scoob's reaction to phony ghosts. shards of this mindset even get reflected here by what i thought was velma's occult bookstore being just a shop that sells mystery novels - even in fiction, the headless horseman is just a real estate investor doing valuation fraud! basically my ideal version of scooby doo is something like <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/film/mirage-men/" rel="nofollow">MIRAGE MEN::</a></p><p>and despite the "real life isnt scooby doo" mantra of establishment conspiracy-debunkers, you can see the formula played exactly like a 'doo villain scheme in everything from ted gunderson, scieno/o.t.o., vallee's ufo as control system &amp; milabs, the 700 club, paul bennewitz, nam's "operation wandering soul": <a href="http://pcf45.com/sealords/cuadai/wanderingsoul.html" rel="nofollow">pcf45.com/sealords/cuadai/wanderingsoul.html</a> --even shit like the skinwalker ranch (did bigelow use art bell &amp; george knapp to fake spooky shit &amp; buy it for pennies?? of course daphne's paranormal show is called "coast to coast" &amp; she names her zombie riff "ghost to ghost" just like art's halloween broadcasts)--</p><p>--or, air force psy-ops pioneer edward lansdale (graham greene's prototype "quiet american"):</p><blockquote><p>When the Philippine army was fighting an insurgency by communist Hukbalahap rebels shortly after the second world war, it seized on some clever tactics to get inside its enemies’ heads.</p><p>In areas where the “Huks” were active, an army psychological warfare squad would spread stories that an asuang (vampire) was loose in the hills. The psywar squad would then set up an ambush, quietly grabbing and killing the last man in the patrol, puncturing his neck with two holes, and draining the corpse of blood before returning it to the trail. Superstitious Huks would then desert the area.</p><p>The asuang ruse is part of the legend of Edward Lansdale, the US Air Force officer and intelligence operative who played a central role in counterinsurgency operations in the Philippines, and later during two tours in Vietnam. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/365e39f6-f21e-11e7-b220-857e26d1aca4" rel="nofollow">www.ft.com/content/365e39f6-f21e-11e7-b220-857e26d1aca4</a></p></blockquote><p>i saw recently some dumb medium post which claimed to explain all the awful "conspiracy theorists" we suffer from nowadays and happened to include rarely-discussed but provable info like the koch bros (="conspiracy theorists"!?) dad being a nazi profiteer, without having the self-awareness to realize that detail itself is something only known or discussed because of work by "conspiracy theorists" theyre "debunking"! instead their take is peasants discussing the (v real) "deep state" means believing in anti-establishment heresy dedicated to absolute obedience and trust in....the trump &amp; kennedy dynasties?? oprah arrested for child sacrifice &amp; donald trump, pedo-hunter (ted cruz plz move on from pretending to be mad at "cuties" &amp; focus on this direct-to-video release's weird deviant-art fetish of sexy catgirls and shaggy &amp; scoob's distended bellies/feeder porn made 2 distract us from how it set off the 20+ yr trend of scoob battling "real" witches &amp; ghosts instead of asshole rich guys like the ones who own the rights to scooby doo, same timeframe &amp; motive as star trek's turn-of-y2k switch from optimistic-futurist to paranoid militarism) <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM365.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM365.pdf</a></p><p>uhh i mean.... scrappy doo found dead in new orleans!! &lt;&lt; "like" this you idiots</p>

<br><b>168: In Search Of The Wow Wow Wibble Woggle Wazzie Woodle Woo</b>
<br><p>philip k dick talked about hearing strawberry fields forever on the radio with new lyrics instructing him to "open his eyes" &amp; look out the window for that "strange, strawberry ice cream pink" beam of light to smack him in the forehead &amp; impart knowledge of his newborn's undiagnosed hernia. he immediately ran into the room where his wife tessa was changing the boy "to recite what has been conveyed to me: that he has an undetected birth defect and must be taken to a doctor at once and scheduled for surgery," dick later recalled. "this turns out to be true."</p><p>the radio's modified beatles verses warned of an abdominal hernia that had burst and descended into the infant's testicles - if he hadnt been rushed to the hospital, it couldve been fatal (they operated, he turned out fine). dick considered the possibilities of thr message's origin: KGB telepaths, his dead twin sister's ghost, an alternate dimension version of himself, or a time-travelling 1st century christian named thomas, but finally figured it was radio signals from ancient extraterrestrial satellite VALIS, which continued transmitting to him over dreams, songs &amp; tv broadcasts (frequently while stoned) until his death. while VALIS was 'revealed' to him, this idea didnt originate with dick - two decades earlier, the u.s. &amp; the soviets scrambled to identify a satellite orbiting over antarctica that neither superpower could claim. since the 1890s astronomers have picked up "impossible" radio signals from an unexplained 'dark' object in polar orbit: THE BLACK KNIGHT.</p><p>in this shockingly-not-xian kiddy special, a man in his 30s plays a boy (?) recruited "in search of" the wow wow wibble woggle wazzie woodle woo after hearing godlike, non-human instructions coded inside lyrics to songs playing over his bedroom radio, like a dream, or pkd's message from beyond. "fringe files" author paul rydeen, in his zine essay "the song remains the same: weird lyrics and altered states," describes clearly hearing alternate lyrics in radio broadcasts of eurythmics' sweet dreams ("fuck me! kill me!") and a non-existent version of "that's life" where sinatra riffs on his mob ties, saying "we'll shoot your ass and you'll die." what is this? it's a testament to how kids stuff like pee-wees playhouse can be "weird" while never feeling like a schizophrenic/psychotic break this way - did tim noah write these songs, or were they transmitted? </p><p>even after the quality degrades from ELO/nilsson soundalikes into raffi-esque toddler jams, theres an incredible amount of talent and creativity put into something that you know just made dumb 80s kids go 'grandma this is weird!!' and switch off for artless product like g.i. joe or disney toons. why make this tape? melody as VHS as radio as influencing machine, like the DVD-manufacturing device "MAKING YOU SICK" in terror toons: turn the dial to static and hear white noise, record an hour between stations and play it back to hear the words ("man," "go home"). the black knight isn't alien, its human, ancient (or? intelligent non-human animal?), one of those lost earth civilizations from millions, or billions of years ago, launched before their extinction. i like to think they sent us this too.</p>

<br><p>much as it pains me to give this rating to a movie that has new-age cult leader tim thomerson + 🚨ROBERT Z'DAR IN BOOTY SHORTS🚨 (later, checkerboard shirt &amp; ska bowler) <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/driving-round-the-desert-like-the-california/" rel="nofollow">driving round the desert like the california love video</a> i cant stop getting annoyed at the miracle mile dude making these really soulful/personal/philosophical science fiction movies full of striking, atmospheric imagery that are also a narcissist's self-absorbed fantasies of women as orbiting satellites/accessories for a sensitive guy and im not sure if its his own actual perspective or not. in both films he gets all the technical elements right, shots/design &amp; performance &amp; music (a weirdly synthy poledouris score carries alot of this just like tang-dream in MILE) but has a 13 yr old boy's ideas of relationships being like "gonna meet my PERFECT gf n be SO IN LOVE unlike THOSE OTHER BOYS i like REAL GIRLS with PERSONALITY ok sorry thats just the KIND OF GUY i am!"🙄 ive long defended miracle mile for its big heart despite the flawed/complex (?) protagonist but watching this, idk - look how he casts the best character actors in all the quirky dude roles (marshall bell! brion james!) but women only exist as bitches or quirkmaidens in relation- shit makes jim wyrnoski look like douglas sirk (imo bimbo movies are the women's pictures of the 80s). melanie griff's always great &amp; tries to light up a nothing-y role but her badass tracker "e. johnson" (who inspired big johnson tee mascot "e. normous johnson") has no interiority or personality aside from protecting the hero and doing cool stuff like bazook'ing a desert butte. even tasha yar's pynchon-reading biz-butch in MILE exists only to pass along classified info from her nuke-knowing ex-bf. see, in the end (SPOILERS) us fellas gotta betray these shallow gals for the RIGHT kind of woman, right? our hero makes the romantic decision to push his sexxbot out of the plane like a gag from macgruber ("oh my god, i dont love her... get the fuck outta here!!") but my dream ending when they realize the load is too heavy melanie's like ok loser you get out, us ladies are taking the plane! looks incredible tho, some bright, plasticky corner of hell's frogtown ("glory hole") that feels weirdly r-rated but also like a kids movie? wish i liked it more but imo this was only improved on in jovovich/anderson's resident evils</p>

<br><p>lmao when this started on a painting of an old grey farmhouse i was like oh god is this gonna be fucking ed gein's house and yup!</p><p>all this reeks of try-hard/effort but somehow joe balances out badboy affectations with his soft-spoken, chill demeanor &amp; authentic/undeniable talent, contrasted by scenes where the incredibly corny jim jarmusch shows up in a "route 666" (whoaaah!!) shirt talking about smoking in/spitting on churches &amp; its so (endearingly) lame but joe is like yeah, good, ok. i watch this kinda self-indulgent/self-mythologizing 90s edgelord stuff with a groan but also a sense of how refreshing and rare these perspectives are in our smooth, purely-aestheticized now, especially when the guy himself is so anxious despite his fuck-you persona (kinda like CRUMB, which also has dian hanson who pops up here as joe's ex gf mad that he never yelled at her). crazy how all the 20 yr old lbxdrs have zero memories or experience of actual 90s bullshit up to like 2004 bcz to me literally everything thats happened since then feels like a reference or reaction to the pre-9/11 crap we experienced firsthand &amp; theres never gonna be enough context or history to explain it to anyone who didnt survive it, til you realize guys like this experienced all of that plus the 80s and 70s and 60s in a way that i will never ever understand and start to think ok joe's been doing this stuff since like 78, i dunno maybe he was the first one to paint ed gein's house???</p>

<br><b>291: Camp Blood 8 Revelations</b>
<br><p>mid-watchable comedy slasher w/ animated blood, an off-the-rack party city "latex snake tongue clown mask" &amp; loud, campy incest plot. way too much of the ubiquitous, intensely annoying shawn c philips, who im pretty sure was already in one of these, but im proud to have lived long enough to experience backwoods slashers with gags about fake news and emoji balloons in the killers cabin. fake b52s song over the credits sounds like linnea quigleys band from dr alien and one of the girls does a pretty good kelly bundy.</p>
<br><b>292: Arise Subgenius Recruitment Film 16</b>

<br><b>295: Blade The Iron Cross</b>
<br><p>bladee: the drainer cross</p><p>best thing about the last p.m. (aXIs: termination) was immediately killing off all the boring human characters from the prev 2 but now this "solo spinoff" immediately fucks that up bringing back the russian clairvoyant girl and doesnt even include her psychic dwarf dad!! they do add some sexual tension between her &amp; blade ("getting aroused, are you?" charlie nooo) but its not evil bong or anything. the bad guys are cops collaborating with nazis and theres even a francoist bad girl so charlie band stays on his antifasche aktion despite letting zahler turn his babies into stormfront kinkfic for c1nestate. actually its directed by killjoy goes to hell auteur john lechago which is why my expectations were a lil higher than usual &amp; only about 70% met. as a title character blade is barely in it (less than some sequels that arent blade spinoffs) but when he is theres actual stop motion, some great gore (via tom devlin's 1313fx) and the puppet looks p good after some fucked-up bootleg ones in the last few, tho now hes got a huge zdar/quagmire jaw for some reason and without the hat looks like lee van cleef in escape from new york. the full moon-mandated length of 70 min makes it feel more like an interlude or a short than a feature but i still had fun - the bmovie market is so sharknado'd out now (with FM working mostly in that lane - cant wait for BARBIE AND KENDRA JOIN SPACE FORCE) its cool to see something zero-budget thats (almost) 100% serious in mood &amp; style while still having cool bmovie shit like a tesla death ray and characters who get naked for no reason. cameo watch: one of the guys working at the old timey newspaper ("mae west in love with gorilla!") is dustin ferguson, director of NEMESIS 5 + HORNDOGS BEACH PARTY!</p>

<br><b>311: Hidden Memories Are You A Ufo Abductee</b>
<br><p>holy shit look at this tape! guess whats on it?! an elderly budd hopkins standing behind a hyatt podium for 88 minutes!! they used to sell these shits out the back of ufo mags for like 40 bucks (my copy has an $89.95 sticker that im hoping is ex-rental). spoiler alert: i hate budd hopkins. there is some kinda-fun shit early on, like him describing a child's story of being captured by large, hairless cats, but of course he immediately gets into sexual abuse and trauma/dysfunction so intrusive &amp; depressing that big budd started to remind me of the hypnosis guy who got busted with a collection of abductee panties. he sez its "proven" 2-5% of americans have been taken up &amp; implanted - fifteen million of em! this is all horseshit of course. budd gets into "scoops" (mutilations, not tmz exclusives) and ridiculous stories of linda napolitano, the abductee that mufon called "the case of the century!!" but its all the same ol crap. heres my take - the greys &amp; the reptoids are being framed. theres 2 things going on here: the ufology racket, infested &amp; swarming with spies, feds, scammers and perverts, vs centuries of the real experiences of humans w/ transient malfunctions of reality, all of them standing outside career ufology &amp; gross abduction scams, cover-ups, pranks &amp; disinfo. </p><p>whats crazy is that in an earlier life budd was an abstract expressionist*, a good one, who hung out with cia-funded talents like rothko &amp; de kooning, but never let abstract, non-linear/non-representational thought influence him towards any nuance in the abduction question - unless "abstract art" was his job in the 50s just like ufology was in the 80s, all for the same employer. </p><p>:: <a href="https://contemporaryartdaily.com/2018/05/budd-hopkins-at-downs-ross/" rel="nofollow">contemporaryartdaily.com/2018/05/budd-hopkins-at-downs-ross/</a></p><p>before intel agencies killed off real metaphysical/fortean studies, contact with higher beings &amp; weird forces of nature represented something knotty &amp; sacred to be researched, debated, but understood on a deeper spiritual level than 'when aliens attack!' sundays on fox. the cia &amp; pentagon reverse-engineered the ufology biz just like the mockingbird media, not just to control perceptions of experience but to manufacture their own experiences, slotted alongside the real thing. </p><p>betty &amp; barney hill - an interracial, politically-active couple in 1960s new hampshire, both in the NAACP, with barney on the u.s. commission for civil rights - first talked about their alien abductors looking like "a red-headed irishman hostile to negroes" (barney) and "german nazis in black army uniforms" not big-eyed greys. betty described a short guy in a suit with black hair and a "jimmy durante" nose drugging &amp; probing her. does that sound extraterrestrial to you? but what interest would feds &amp; army goons have with civil rights activists in the 60s? </p><p>there's an answer for this question: milabs (military abductions)</p><p>in "the controllers"* martin cannon theorizes that "alien" abductions are psychological mind control operations, extensions of the govt's documented human experiments done in prisons, college campuses, and low-income neighborhoods. cannon's theory was so hostile to the leaders of ufology that his work is hard to find even now</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815072228/http://www.visitations.com/cannon/cannon.htm/" rel="nofollow">web.archive.org/web/20000815072228/http://www.visitations.com/cannon/cannon.htm/</a></p><p>but at some point in the 90s people started tracking locations of historical abductions on maps, and found most of em taking place a stones throw from established military bases - actual recorded ones, not the hidden D.U.M.B.s of infowars guys. and now they dont even need bases! they can park a truck outside your house and without ever coming anywhere near you "run" an entire abduction scenario inside your brain, radio &amp; magnetic frequencies provoking temporal lobe epilepsy to create "physical" presences, missing time &amp; out of body experiences. as vallee said, the ufo is most like a television. we're not 100% back in the clinton-era pop-kitsch wave yet but alongside phony disclosures i predict this coming decade will have controlled misdirection of ironic &amp; quasi-religious ufo belief, abuse of our unconscious yearnings for divinity as the world becomes scarier &amp; less stable, something that starts organically like the optimistic, anti-war contactees but ends up with new ufo celebs telling you what you saw as a psychological "strategy of tension"</p><p>for example, on this tape hopkins talks about abductees "inventing" a "screen memory" of black helicopters taking them up to the sky, overriding what he insists is the "actual" memory of an interstellar saucer. but what if he's coercing them under hypnosis to remember army choppers as a ufo? abductees describe being handed a gun and told to use it on another person - not an alien! - tied to a chair, manchurian candidate-style. does this sound like hyper-dimensional advanced spacefarers to you? or something you can imagine cold war pentagon docs &amp; hoover's fbi doing? budd's brainwashed abductees got shepherded into new age cults led by "ex"-cia special forces like bolo-tied ufologist virgil armstrong, a guy who spent 9 years in the cia &amp; 10 with the green berets, collaborator with iran contra general john singlaub who headed the neo-nazi world anti-communist league (now the "world league for freedom and democracy" that was supported by john mccain) selling arms to mercs &amp; fascist militias around the global south. in the 80s "ex"-cia armstrong recruited budd's abductees into mass psychic channeling sessions to send hostile, negative vibes to communist leaders like general secretary of the soviet union konstantin chernenko:</p><p>:: <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1990-12-02-2768415-story.html" rel="nofollow">www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1990-12-02-2768415-story.html</a></p><p>"only small secrets need protection" said mcluhan, "the big ones are kept secret by public incredulity." in my experience, mufon pushes back hard against milab theory, insisting on the (somehow) more scientific explanation of little grey bugmen from space. hopkins' own ex-wife came out to say he boosted phony cases with mufon's help, tho i believe she claims he was tricked &amp; didnt care to double-check(?). hypnosis is used for coercion, not research. its not for uncovering facts. but budd only had a few professionals challenging him, like in this blog comment from hypnotherapist judy jaafar:</p><blockquote><p>Some years ago I met Budd at a UK conference and a select few, including Nick Pope and myself had retired to the bar. I had been appalled at the things Budd had been saying in his lecture,so decided to ask him,in a polite and friendly manner,about his hypnosis qualifications,his basic understanding of the subject and what protocols he used to ensure the safety of his "clients". He flustered,then blustered then told me that he deliberately introduced red herrings into his questioning,things that were not part of the "official" abduction scenario,and if the client agreed to this spurious element then he knew they were lying. It was breathtaking in its foolishness,by patently leading the witness into describing something they thought Hopkins wanted to hear. He had no conception of the strength of compliance of someone under hypnosis - that's why it works so well as a psychological therapy (not an investigative tool). When I challenged him on this,and other things, he jumped up and stormed out of the room. Nick was furious with me for upsetting the master of abduction research. I was equally furious that people like Hopkins and Jacobs were getting away with this in pursuit not of the truth but some other agenda. I have no wish to speak ill of the dead, but to be honest I'm glad he is no longer practising such chicanery. </p><p><a href="http://ufotrail.blogspot.com/2013/09/youre-getting-sleepy-and-misled.html?showComment=1450486290561#c4132477417294307534" rel="nofollow">ufotrail.blogspot.com/2013/09/youre-getting-sleepy-and-misled.html?showComment=1450486290561#c4132477417294307534</a></p></blockquote><p>forced-rape abduction mythology &amp; other intensely negative rabbit holes of ufology act as loosh/garmonbozia generators designed to trap anyone thinking about departing consensus reality into their fear-frequency propaganda, exchanging one oppressive belief system for another</p><p>U Figure it Out im bout to have a close encounter with a garbage can</p>

<br><p>goldblum's dorky, lanky physicality (playing a guy w/ the 2005 rapper name "nick deezy") &amp; cyndi lauper doing a kinda mae west harley quinn thing have legit chemistry in this ESP screwball adventure, esp. with columbo playing what feels like a lloyd kaufman character. everybody in the stacked cast is great (googy gress had me rollin) which mostly covers up how plotless and sloppy (&amp; uninterested in ecuador, to a lowkey racist extent) this is. p much what im always looking for when tired/stressed, a forgotten '87-'94 hollywood fantasy-comedy that feels like a beloved childhood vhs classic but one nobody remembers or cares about. they knew their shit on the psychic stuff too - zener cards! astral projection! psychometry (touching things)! "ingo swedlin" obv ref to remote viewing pioneer ingo swann - even the panpipe-y horner score feels inspired by new age/coast to coast AM favs cusco - and doesnt make fun of it, which does mean its kinda disappointing when nothing really happens in the ran-outta-money energy pyramid finale. wiki sez it was greenlit as "ghostbusters romancing the temple of doom" and of couse ackroyd was the star but dropped out when lauper was cast (why? shes great) leaving his "ghosts are real, dudes" perspective that makes this legit to me - ive gone from making fun of his dopey psi-factor intros to never wanting to watch a movie about the supernatural made by ppl who dont really believe in it ever again. unfortunately movies in this mid-budget range have the problem where they dont have fx setpiece $$ to really wow like raiders or 'busters but theyre not willing to get down in the mondo trasho gutter like corman or charlie band do when ripping off the same genre blockbuster crap (some princess bride level bad soundstages in this) and still i laffed more than i have at any movie in a long time. recommended! </p><p>cf HIGH SPIRITS</p>

    						</h3>
<div><blockquote><p>"When I asked him where he was from, he replied, 'I am from the Planet that is called Venus.'</p><p>I asked him how many visitors from Venus were presently on Earth and he said, 'There are presently seventy-seven of us walking among you in the United States. We are constantly coming and going."</p></blockquote><p>a holy visitor of the pentagonal lodge! dr frank e. stranges ("not strange!") is a real yukster and takes for- fucking- ever to get around to his story of meeting a damn alien who lived for 3 years at the pentagon which might be the most important revelation in history but we gotta throw in some wife jokes &amp; pastor anecdotes to sweeten the tale, right?? (kinda like how he spent a decade after "contact" writing books about saucers that never mention being introduced to the pilot of one) eventually frank throws a bone to the crowd at this red roof inn or whatever and gets around to it:</p><p>his hunky venusian angel was valiant thor, a name that shares the same inhuman, procedurally-generated quality as john keel's "indrid cold" or popular millennial housepaint color "agreeable gray." according to frank, thor was six feet tall, 185 lbs, had six fingers on each hand, an oversized heart, one giant lung, copper oxide blood like an octopus, i.q. "off the scale" (he estimates 1200), and could speak a hundred languages fluently (including non-human ones). he told frank things about his family history even he didnt know, and shaking his fingerprintless hand was like touching the skin of a baby with the strength of a man.</p><p>ok, lil bit hard to believe but i love the idea of this big earthbound alien dude just chillen at the p-gon 3 years like a foreign exchange student, eating govt hot dogs, loungin in his "liquid sunshine" suit and sitting down with eisenhower, neil h. mcelroy &amp; vp nixon, who subjected him to a "barrage of hostile questions."</p><p>is this shit for real? was frank stranges carted around &amp; fed loony disinfo about 'valiant thor' that he spun off into his own con game?? was he inspired reading PRINCE VALIANT + THOR comix while watching THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL like adamski &amp; other "peaceful space brother" contactees? can aliens love jesus? was val part of puharich's council of nine, an inspiration for norse myth the way the nine were the gods of egypt &amp; greece? was he born from military intel, hollyweird, lemuria, inner earth, another dimension, or another world? can you live on another planet in our solar system? is that why gore testified to the senate how CO2 is "turning earth's atmosphere into venus"?</p><p>LIFE ON VENUS: <br/>*gravity 91 percent of earth<br/>*surface can melt lead, but the tallest mountaintops have 50-80 f degree temps<br/>*ultraviolet photos show dark lines ("unknown UV absorbers") that carl sagan proposed were microorganisms in the upper atmosphere photosynthesizing UV light<br/>*31 miles above the surface is habitable</p><p>i like goofy 50s contactee mythology more than 90s abduction trauma but the shitty side of nordic humanoid stories is how many of em end up overwhelmingly square, christian &amp; kinda racist (blue-eyed bible-reading scandinavians bring us a message of bourgeois peace). frank's reports of a hidden e.t./pentagon pact share qualities with the technically similar lectures on deep underground military bases by phil schneider but imo those are way more credible and dont have any cornball jesus shit in em. the greatest blonde vs brunette debate of all time isnt betty and veronica, its the 2 competing photos of valiant thor:</p><p><a href="https://sciencevibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VALIANT-1-768x384.jpg" rel="nofollow">sciencevibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/VALIANT-1-768x384.jpg</a></p><p>that's stranges' val on the left, schneider's on the right (phils dad, capt. otto "oscar" schneider behind him)</p><p>phil schneider drove home from the conference where he'd held up this pic, telling his wife he'd "be killed" for it, and died the next day (by "suicide"). meanwhile stranges peddles this goofy crap for decades grinning at the absurdity of it all, getting bored halfway thru his own bullshit to meander &amp; hype self-help scams, prosperity gospel and "the secret of using the third eye." he closes out this tape, his own "personal" story, with a slideshow of the laffably fake billy meier saucer photos</p><p>then again, schneider said val had to wear a massive containment suit all the time to breathe, which isnt in his dad's pic. maybe he slipped it off for the photo? phil also said val didnt leave after '59, disclosing how the venusian was still being "held" here in the early 90s (!). some of the new age #MAGA trump=pleiadian believers say they've spotted valiant thor in the background of air force one pics, and a guy on reddit claims he saw him at a subway eating a $5 footlong!</p><blockquote><p>I believe I encountered this same venusian entity myself. This happened back in early 2009, when I was still in middle school. I had just gotten out of school and arrived home. For some weird reason, my mother had a desire to go to Subway to grab some food to go. I figured why not, as I was somewhat hungry. So we arrive there, and all of a sudden I see a man that looks exactly like Valiant Thor, sitting at a table eating a sandwich and it appeared he was talking with someone witting across from him ( I didn't get a chance to see the other entity). There were no other customers in the restaurant, just this Valiant Thor entity and whoever else he was with. I specifically remember he was wearing a blue-buttoned shirt with the sleeves wrapped up to his forearms, with jeans and boots. He had gray slicked back hair, he looked like an ordinary middle-aged farmer you would see. However, he just didn't feel right. He was talking to this other person in a soft, whispering voice almost, and he was staring at me and watching me so intently the whole time I was there. I remember having the distinct impression he was reading my thoughts, the feeling was so strong that I actually felt very uncomfortable being close to his presence. My mother and me were only at the Subway restaurant for about 2 minutes before we got our food and left.</p></blockquote><p>[ ??did val develop a taste for subway at the pentagon?? ]</p><blockquote><p>The Concourse Food Court is the largest food court on the Pentagon Reservation and hosts nine dining options for your consideration:</p><p>Baskin Robbins—serving ice cream treats<br/>Burger King—offers the complete Burger King breakfast and dinner menu options<br/>Dominic's of New York—offers breakfast and lunch sandwiches made to order<br/>Dunkin' Donuts—offers fresh brewed coffee, donuts, bagel, and a variety of sandwiches<br/>Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen—offers the complete Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen breakfast and dinner menu options<br/>Rollerz—builds personalized wrap-style sandwiches<br/>Starbucks—offers hot or iced coffees, fresh fruit, and pastries<br/><b>Subway—fresh, made to order submarine sandwiches</b><br/>Surf City Squeeze—offers a variety of smoothies and healthy wraps</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141025073652/https://www.whs.mil/our-services/building-facilities/dining" rel="nofollow">web.archive.org/web/20141025073652/https://www.whs.mil/our-services/building-facilities/dining</a></p><p>then there's the unfulfilled 2017 foia request from georgia wrestler donnie brooke asking trump's director of natl intelligence to give up all dox about thor: <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/2017/August-2017-FOIA-Log.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.dni.gov/files/documents/FOIA/2017/August-2017-FOIA-Log.pdf</a></p><p>DF-2017-00365 REQUEST ANY INFORMATION ON COMMANDER VAL VALIANT THOR - BROOKE, DONNIE 08/17/2017</p><p>was thor the inspiration for another wrestler, wwe superstar VAL VENIS ("val" from venus)? did chicago rapper king louie, who coined the term "chi-raq," draw his 2012 viral dance &amp; song "val venis" the same source? like amelia earheart, louie attended hyde park academy h.s., which in november 1957 had four evacuations from bomb threats. stranges says thor's horror at civilian bombings was what inspired his trip to earth. as louie repeats over the 'val venis' hook;</p><p>"little do they know..."</p><p>venis left wrestling to become "kaptain kannabis" the 'budtender' at a dispensary in mesa, arizona called purple haze (like the phoenix lights?) where he sold edibles like "alien animal crackers" and "hammers of thor," imprinted with the weapon of the avengers hero. 5 years after val landed, marvel's thor was created by jack kirby, a man obsessed with ancient extraterrestrials, the supernatural &amp; the occult (and his own UFO sighting!). kirby's drawings of thor feature prominently in the assassination trigger montage of 1974's THE PARALLAX VIEW.</p><p>"im asked why the gods left us. they never left. they arrived and they stayed"</p><p>is frank's wild story, endorsed by admiral byrd's nephew harley byrd and eisenhower's granddaughter laura, true? did the lessons passed on by his own newsletter "the interspace link," which read like joel osteen imitating l.ron hubbard, come from unearthly authority? as paul told timothy, 'the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.' </p><p>i hate to cite the fbi on anything but when they investigated frank stranges for impersonating a fed they came to this conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>Dr. Stranges is an evangelist.

"No substantial COVID genotypes have emerged after first generation [transgenic] waves," authors of a BQB study conclude. "This suggests that the measured B meson decay for COVID-19 is small, which is consistent with the observation that some irradiated COVID strains can survive for at least 2000 generations in GMO feed, despite the fact that their counterparts do not." the alien origins of COVID explain the high-affinity binding of its peptlomers to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the effect of "mass testing on human or human-like subjects" before release. other COVID studies have focused on the response in some COVID-19 lines to different radioactive applications, such as its ability to protect humans exposed to UV light from sunburn. one study also showed that COVID-19 lines expressed "much higher" levels of COX-2 in response to exposure to cigarettes (0.9) with a spurious resemblance of quark decay, which takes place in about 1% of all "beta" decays (Bibby 1987). the best evidence that 5G wi-fi is irrelevant to the virology of egyptian astrophysics lies in this fact: "There is no known mechanism that provides an explanation for why approximately half of all products could be expected from two- and three-lead decays." This fact, which was first identified by BQBS director Hajcak (1990), has been incorporated into 3-D simulations of Q decay (in Bradbury and Raynaud 1998) and in some experimental evidence (Bayliss and Budel 2003). observed on a quantum level, this form of mathematical symmetry was glimpsed in the real world for the first time in laboratory observations of the COVID-19 virus. </p><p><a href="https://www.cygnustechnologies.com/browse/host-cell-dna-detection-kits-reagents-and-components" rel="nofollow">www.cygnustechnologies.com/browse/host-cell-dna-detection-kits-reagents-and-components</a></p><p>~Tom Hanks Blood Being Used To Develop Coronavirus Vaccine~</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/tom-hanks-coronavirus-blood-research-vaccine-1234589978/" rel="nofollow">variety.com/2020/film/news/tom-hanks-coronavirus-blood-research-vaccine-1234589978/</a></p><p>hanks in sully: "BIRDS!" <a href="https://i.ibb.co/603TFVX/birds.jpg" rel="nofollow">i.ibb.co/603TFVX/birds.jpg</a></p><p>"It's like a giant computer program and everything that happens, you look at the state, and that's how it gives you the answer," said Bernhard Weiland, associate professor of physics at Pritzker College and spokesperson for the Sloan Institute. </p><p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8166049/ABCs-medical-expert-Normal-Swan-goes-self-isolation.html" rel="nofollow">www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8166049/ABCs-medical-expert-Normal-Swan-goes-self-isolation.html</a></p><p>fun fact: the God Set (A.K.A.

Now it's coming back to the U.S. Fuck the U.S. I want to see the U.S. wiped out." Fischer added that the events of September 11 provided the ideal opportunity to stage a long-overdue coup d'état. He envisioned, he said, a "Seven Days in May scenario," with the country taken over by the military; he also hoped to see all its synagogues closed, and hundreds of thousands of Jews executed.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/12/bobby-fischer-s-pathetic-endgame/302634/" rel="nofollow">www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/12/bobby-fischer-s-pathetic-endgame/302634/</a></p><p><a href="https://unredacted.com/2011/01/11/bobby-fischer-the-cia-and-the-kgb/" rel="nofollow">unredacted.com/2011/01/11/bobby-fischer-the-cia-and-the-kgb/</a></p><p>after the 1 hr targ lecture you get a bogus mini doc of uri geller doing parlor tricks at SRI with him and edgar mitchell. hogwash!</p>

("shes got 2 monkeys on her back: shes a bloody lesbian and a heroin addict") same guy in marco rubio-heeled boots &amp; fritz the cat bellbottoms milking his prostate &amp; gay-bashing a dumpy chickenhawk queen who looks like fred armisen playing tiny tim playing bunny breckenridge ?? mild, acoustic soft-rock ballad. "oh, dont worry... things like that only happen in nightmares" (makes pornhub-worthy phonecall to mom while fucking his sister &amp; nutting inside a goat who scream like a man when he slits its throat) - "get the sword, kill them all!" </p><p>ends with a sick joke on a farm that looks like a big block of feta (the greek version of a gingerbread house) where a sheep farmer swats away their murder-scene jackoff camera (v sensitive about photography on rape island) buttfucks the sado-maso killer then does a peter griffin ("hey meg, guess what") and fucking FARTS on him &amp; throws him in a pit of limestone ("this gave me a lot to think about") while his sisterwife picks the sheep farter, who loves farting so much i think he may be the dad of the guy from FART: THE MOVIE. 4.5 stars.</p>

<br><b>454: Final Kill</b>
<br><p>cheap-looking dtv action-comedy without a lot of action and only a little more comedy. star ed morrone is technically a "bad" actor but his sarcastic, neurotic hired gun has some 1991 b-movie quality that kept me entertained (he kept reminding me of dave attell) and i found myself genuinely liking him. the script feels like a guy trying to write a shane black parody of MAN ON FIRE and getting bored after 30 pages, but i LOVE one-scene stunt-casting and just like this directors mediocre squatcher BIG LEGEND this has some great, shameless one-scene stunt-casting - danny trejo, randy couture, loveline's drew pinsky (!) and an irrepressible BILLY ZANE looking like a cross between dr. phil and 70s brando. i havent seen alot of sopranos but enough to know the mob stuff is ripping off the sopranos - one detail even gets dismissed with in-movie dialogue as "some sopranos type bullshit". way too long of a jokey setup for a mild payoff that never reaches that queasy mix of comedy &amp; violence i was hoping for, though a kitchen scene where two characters keep breaking bowls and plates over each others heads feels like some shit from naked gun until it doesnt. its all more of an incident than a movie, a pile of half-finished sketches, only 75 min til the blooper reel starts, but i had an okay time</p>

Even the ones that people say are quote-unquote bad are better than no comic book movies.") was already baked in by 94 but i do miss the guy who would do shit like rip off shots from spike lee instead of whatever the hell this is, and i saw JAY &amp; SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK - one of the best comedies of the 00s - at the theater twice! this movie desperately needs an ending like that ones morris day &amp; the time "jungle love" dance party, tho recognizing HOW HIGH as the greatest film of all time is a start. post-bypass big kev confronting his mortality &amp; realizing life's true priorities is all of us now lol</p>

<br><b>499: Beyond The Spectrum The Underground</b>
<br><p>i forgot id tried to watch this before so it started up right where i'd turned it off, immediately throwing up a bunch of graphic suicide(?)/autopsy photos of its subject - despite that tasteless note its a surprisingly touching portrait of phil schneider, a very strange person who you learn more about than you do about his time in underground bases staffed by sinister, conspiring reptoids. previously only seen lecturing marriott conference rooms on grainy vhs you can buy off doomsday preppers at gun shows, this departed whistleblower's message &amp; personality really shine thru all the research put into this low-budget conspiracy doc - home video footage &amp; interviews with phil's widow humanize someone i only really knew for showing off his raygun injuries sustained in firefights with greys running 45-ton tunnel drills underneath dulce, new mexico. the stuff about his nazi/paperclip dad carrying around letters from the philadelphia experiment confirms this whole thing seems like a psyop cover story (morris k jessup also committed "suicide" after being fed weirdo military disinfo by "carlos allende", as laid out in jacques vallee's 1991 book "revelations" and 1994 article "anatomy of a hoax") where earnest, credible guys like this get lied to, crippled, ruined &amp; thrown in a ditch.

<br><b>520: Quantum Hologram Esp</b>
<br><p>"let your thoughts run wild"</p><p>the quantum hologram is a thought, based on photon emissions from all objects: you, me, any physical object of macroscopic size (molecular and above) emits quanta and absorbs quanta of energy. the photons that come from objects contain information like invisible RNA, a viscous yellow crystal - these aren't new holographic technologies or ways of encoding information that just pop out of some strange aether (as it were) these are clever means of manipulating things you don't know, so as to access other things you can't access.</p><p>our eyes create photons. visual perception is accomplished by rays or "beams" emitted outward from our eyes, NOT the reverse. historically emission theory has been suppressed and replaced by "intromission" theory, but our eyes are not the "detectors" of photons, they are the creator of photons. democritus, aristotle, euclid, plato all knew this. when milton went blind, he wrote "i consider that my light is spent," meaning he had lost the capacity to generate these beams. the liquid inside the eye is transparent, like the air outside. together they form a common photon medium able to sense the nature of objects within it. there is no "perception" of information through the medium, but rather the medium as a whole, including the eye itself becomes sentient.</p><p>have you ever seen an animal while driving at night? their eyes are shining bright. have you seen your eyes turn red in a photograph? the ancient greeks saw the fire gleaming in creatures eyes - pliny the elder mentioned eye light emitted by cats, wolves &amp; wild goats. raccoons, dogs, ferrets &amp; alligators all have "eyeshine." the greeks knew our eyes create light - photons. this is why animals can see in the dark, this is why when you look at a bright light the light persists inside your eyes, and why when your eyes are tapped or pressed you see strong light flashes. light from our eyes serves to "feel" the world like how the blind interact through touch, a direct outward contact. think about "piercing eyes" or "evil eyes" - we know this is true, and "chemical retinal reactions" don't explain it.</p><p>the thought hologram from our eyes is an energy pattern that photons are created from. as light from all objects decays, photons get absorbed by quantum objects and disappear in radiation due to polarization of light (a pair of oppositely polarized photons). a photon only goes one direction at any given time, so when it gets inside a vibrating object, its polarization reverses and, as light, goes out the other as a double helix, observed in all known living things on earth.</p><p>i myself am a lab rat/guinea pig for this stuff so i expect to find a lot of misinformation as we swim thru the streams of wiki, youtube and the digital inkblots of letterboxd, rummaging thru the contents of my body and body language, my cousin psychically knew how to physically manipulate my body into an ETK with all that information floating around. once he'd physically pull out all that information, my cousin and i can be on any planet in the solar system . . . inside our bodies.</p><p>we saw them on mars and i tried to absorb this one detail and refer to it later, but after looking at it and speaking with him on the phone, all i could think of was "it was a long time ago" - if the man had just called the tribune, wouldn’t they have kept him on the phone, asking about the journey? this man had been dead for a long time, or so i thought. the reason for this detail is important. sadly, it seems like we were not the only one to see the evidence of reptilian structures. astronomer william tompkins, a gazer of modern night skies and professor of earth sciences at the university of california, has discovered ancient reptilian structures covering the walls of a mausoleum in washington, d.c.... each story told on the walls is an entirely different experience (from utopian/diabolic manor homes to alien gulags to outer limits-inspired chicago punk and straight-up ETK-like escapes)</p><p>LEMURIAN READING LIST</p><p>Visit Edgar's Private Elysium: Watcher, Witness, Beholder</p><p>Paul + Janelle: The Secret Life of Humans and Orchids</p><p>Exploring Current Wavefronts of the Holographic Universe for Earth Rescue</p><p>Triune Man and Double Woman</p><p>Gurdjieff's Pan: Religion with an Esoteric History</p><p>Holo-Metaphysical Dimension: UFOs, Giants, Yalda's Mount, Qibla, Spirit Guides and more </p><p>The Divine Adventure: A Spiritual Journey to Prove Time and Space Travel Isn't Possible</p><p>Time Visitors by Claudia Davis</p><p>Interstellan Overdrive by Tom Dick </p><p>Fictional Is Better Than No Time at All (??????????)</p><p>----"ME FOR THE FIRST TIME"---</p><p>Donald Trump is an alien from Pleiades</p><p>Barack Obama went to Mars through a stargate in 2009</p><p>Obama in 2009: 'If we do it, we can put a man on Mars'</p><p>Obama soars to the top of the class.

What they are doing is using "We can't solve the problem" to excuse their inaction.</p><p>If Barack Obama's 2020 campaign slogan was "One Truth, Two Truths," this "song" would be a clear-cut answer to that. </p><p>UFOs, 'neo-christians', homosexuals , @realDonaldTrump all extremely real.

<br><p>another paramount moonbeamer that feels like an actual 90s kids movie, which means its (disappointingly) clever &amp; charming but still irritating, cheap as fuck &amp; has shit like margot kidder (!) as a psychotic cryptozoologist, the "rock godzilla" song from PREHYSTERIA, and alternate "giant" universe versions of nixon, elvis and john f kennedy. dave decoteau reused the actual beanstalk prop for beach babes 2: cave girl island! the first-time director (who went on to make relatively mainstream shit) and the kid from the sandlot (also johnny mysto's best friend) contribute to the "real movie" feel.</p>

<br><p>somebody on here dinged this as a "tv detective" story instead of i guess pure uncut glorious art-house cinema or whatever but i think the stuff that keeps it from being totally pretentious or oblique is what i love about it. thoughtful, delicate, kinda like a canadian almodovar, with as much to say about the transactional nature of relationships as fassbinder or eyes wide shut but with empathy &amp; curiosity instead of nihilist resignation or horror. in a dumber movie bruce greenwood's character would become a bronson type vigilante instead of turning inward - its an emotional terrain i cant remember seeing a movie confront before. i know a couple other egoyans but tell me where to find more stuff like this!!</p>

"don't be afraid... bad dreams are only dreams. what a time you chose to be born..." - SHOGUN ASSASSIN</p><p>this has so many cool stories &amp; reenactments i can kinda forgive it leaning towards the selfish egoism side of metaphysics - my theory is ppl get into new age stuff either to 1) be humbled by the complexity of the universe beyond what we know or to 2) engage in petty self-flattery, indulgence &amp; narcissism (law of attraction, astrology, atlantean past life royalty, etc) like, this weekend at a new age bookstore i saw a book about channeling abraham or some shit boasting it has "how to get exactly what you want at any time, all the time" like thats some shit we should be striving for and not a childish, unevolved desire. so this has 70s star stefanie powers (DIE! DIE! MY DARLING, THE ASTRAL FACTOR, THE BIONIC WOMAN: RETURN OF BIGFOOT) promising in her opening narration dreams can "make you rich and famous" but thankfully they move off that to a soothing weirdo potpurri where the aesthetics &amp; scope end up crystallizing into something impossible not to vibe &amp; coalesce to</p>

<br><p>as a kid i always wanted to rent this on video but never did - turns out its nowhere near as good as penelope spheeris's Don't Be A Menace To Herbert Wayans: Re-Animator should be! i absolutely do not give a fuck about econ students competing for jobs at a wall-street investment firm, even if theyre half-trying to say something about class &amp; race in academia &amp; make marlon wayans out to be a COMPASSIONATE wannabe-banker. its rated R (why??) but the jokes all seem aimed at kids even younger than i was at the time &amp; everybody seems like a miserable asshole even before theyre sharing scenes with david spade</p><p>its depressing when guys like brad dourif (who plays the lead in the kinda movies we like) show up in "normal" roles as a bland side-character who's supposed the like weirdest weirdo they can think of but has nothing interesting to do, just as a reminder that nobody in the straight world understands or takes this stuff seriously (like how 80s scream queens get to ACT in dave decoteau movies but have to play "STRIPPER CORPSE #2" in ANOTHER 48 HOURS or whatever). he mostly just reads his lines off the page but has a lil speech about power also being a drug thats played totally straight and its cool. there's clips from decline of western civilization, lotsa neon green fluid (tm findlay) including marlon wayans' piss, a visibly bored rip torn, patrick ewing cameo, 1998 big beat sndtrk (crystal method, fatboy slim, moby, p.m. dawn, a post-horrorcore gravediggaz track and that d'n'b "urban takeover" jungle brothers remix from mtv's amp 2 cd) and a weirdly melancholy original score by yello (!?). </p><p>also matthew lillard is bi, straightedge, has a dick-piercing &amp; goes full dashiki hotep at the end (rocking kente &amp; a kufi) so the fact this isnt 5 stars should give you a "sense" of how bad the rest is. this shit was NOT worth it just to get every 2001 funk flex "im senseless just like marlon" freestyle punchline!</p>

<br><p>ok the first half of this is just comedy people naming apps and websites and saying "hashtag" and seems like some shit id hate (cf "DEEP MURDER") but it won me over by not giving a fuck about self-conscious meta refs or fulfilling genre checklists for guys who want these movies to be a joyless moodboard of shit they already like (tits, gore, neon, tracking). this character-based slasher is bitchy &amp; tawdry, very FINAL STAB-esque - dave decoteau fans welcome here! - and something about that kinda near-bloodless post-scream goof makes it feel more authentic than 8000 gore-soaked hatchet sequels. even would-be hack jokes about facebook &amp; gluten free moms pay off, while shit like a liberal responding to brutal psycho murders with "this country is a disaster at dealing with mental illness" had me laffin out loud. some of the sassy quips veer towards whedon snark but are closer to a paul rudnick (spy mag, marci x, addams family values) script, well-observed &amp; smarter &amp; gayer than that. even when its gimmicky theyre still trying to do a real-deal supernatural horror &amp; have some of that tick-tock carpenterian slasher momentum to go with all the goofy, gossipy pep and phones-but-too-much message. for a catty low-budget throwaway full of nobodies this entertains better than most mainstream studio horror releases - blumhouse wishes theyd made something this fun lately! after seeing a million of these you start to feel confident declaring one of em the real deal and i think this is - boring gorehounds dont bother but if you intentionally watch uncool early-2000s FUBU-era i-know-what-you-did-last-summersploitation like joey lawrence's DO YOU WANNA KNOW A SECRET its a pleasant surprise</p>

<br><p>lol you know when fulci makes you dress up like a zombie hes bout to make a REAL ANIMAL attack you</p><p>seeing this live with frizzi scoring bumped my least loved fulci up a star, prob from only ever knowing an ugly vhs copy my whole life - the "composers cut" is all killer and if i had an edit thats JUST scenes w/music itd be my fav. this was already my most played of his soundtracks &amp; his best ending, in a career of unforgettable endings - i got chills! me n my friends were the only ppl not in black hoodies but there was such a good vibe that only comes in a room of 50-60 ppl excited to hear the theme to "sette note in nero" even if i was the only one rapping gangsta boo's victim of yo own shit in my head. i wish instead of j. carp synth more horror music would ripoff this kinda mournful progrock headbanger-hermann shit (shout out dude who brought his own zombie head to thrash along) it made me think more than usual how frizzi's music really makes fulcis movies, all those looming builds &amp; ambiguous tones, like how any other director/composer wouldve put scary or exciting shit over the hospital zombie kills instead of frizzi's sad hymn of grief &amp; lamentation. every lucio is a surreal trip but seeing the beyond with a room full of people is like experiencing a collective dream, prince of darkness style - i already cant wait to rewatch but its weird knowing ill never enjoy it this much ever again</p>

<br><b>580: Shaft 2019</b>
<br><p>like when i chickened out of reviewing knock knock with "intrusive thots" im ashamed to admit on here how much fun i had watching this. tim story is of course a hack so theres lazy b-roll, clumsy action, bad jokes &amp; dopey, obvious moments but im a sucker for r-rated action/comedy with crotchety gen-gap gags and this has loose, crowd-pleasing momentum that delivers the off-color blaxplo vibe better than the netflix dolemite movie. raunchy, likable goofs like this were a dime a dozen in 1988 (where itd have like, bernie casey, ja'net dubois, miguel nunez jr and, lets say... vanity) but in 2019 even bad boy michael bay is banished to streaming services so wide-releasing shit like this without "deadpool" in it counts as a win, especially with respectable ol' timothy "ride along" story delivering a strong anti-CIA message("fuck working for the man") in the era of marvel's total fusion with the pentagon. sam jackson is having the time of his life driving around listening to das efx, doing trump impressions, flashing a superbowl ring &amp; barfing up coconut water (??) and while shaftson mostly sux &amp; roundtree's just a cameo you get backup from regina hall (outstanding, underused), b-action vet titus welliver &amp; tyler perry alum leland jones as an iconically cornball "okie-dokie" guy. no mayhem or stunts on the level of singleton's shaft or even last year's superfly remake (which rules) but i found myself weirdly caught up in the characters and detective/crime plot &amp; the focus on sons &amp; fathers as impolite rascals dedicated to their community against the establishment took me back to watching story's debut barbershop as a rap-addled teen in athens' dearly-departed georgia square value cinemas. stay thru the credits for a hilariously bad version of the hayes theme from quavo x saweetie - somebody throw young mc's "know how" on here! - and a post-credits maternity ward scene where a cigar-smoking jackson &amp; roundtree welcome the 4th generation of shafts, who's.... a girl???

<br><b>581: Lady Belladonnas Tales From The Inferno</b>
<br><p>way too long &amp; serious for an anthology where the boobarella host wraparound features evil-bongworthy characters like "funny hitler" and "horny ed wood in drag". theres a straight-faced vampire tale, a weird yoga s&amp;m thing, a voodoo curse segment (called "hexit strategy", groan), a cheapo ufo/bodysnatchers riff (with no ufos), and some talky dantes divine comedy shit where the demon looks like he smushed a bunch of junior mints on his face. ambitious &amp; professional for this kinda stuff (an actual score goes a long way) but never feels like more than a carousel of midday horror-con shorts</p>

<br><b>584: Deep Murder</b>
<br><p>nice freeware "horror" font, assholes. didnt know this was a meta comedy slasher when i clicked it on shudder* or i wouldve set the tv on fire &amp; thrown it out the window instead. yup its a.. sigh... retro 80s porno/slasher parody made by dudes only familiar with 80s porno and slashers thru other parodies! by this point i feel like ive written 50 reviews of this kinda glossy "clever" tv tropes shit from cthuhlu-for-president tshirt guys who think theyre smarter than the shit theyre spoofing and at some point i gotta just start linking to those instead of trying to come up with new disses each time. these unfunny dorks got enough production $$ on deck for some okay aesthetix and a score that almost makes it stop feeling like a 2014 snl "digital video short" but its 97% hollow &amp; lame &amp; i didnt laff once! are there i-fucking-love-science jokes?? you bet your frakking awesomesauce ass there is! big ripoff vibes all over - besides all the cabin of le final girls troperie and *chefs kiss* groaner sex puns they reuse the "tight end" joke from ELECTION and jerry oconnell (in pretty good shape for an old guy) plays a shallow leisure suit larryesque riff on his alltimer asshole turn from PIRANHA 3D (a movie that actually delivers what this promises). the other "big star" is dirty work's own shooter mcgavin (also looking p good), who im pleased to say ends up in s&amp;m fetish gear. i hate that this poser movie has more dick than knife+heart!* everybody else is an improv troupe nobody, one of em just doing her "anna faris in scary movie" inpression (the wayans shouldve rolled in &amp; taken over this production, 1953 iran coup style). with every one of these cutesy spoofs i always find myself wishing they'd applied their harvard-grad writers room resources towards actual horror instead of outspending weird dudes who wanna make "porno slashers" with $200 in a garage "bedroom" - imagine what a freak like tim ritter could do with half the budget of just one of these 6 or 7 epic-snark hulu zomcom musicals we get each month! not surprised the director worked on funnyordie skits AND comedy central's forgotten 2015 synthwave archer-ripoff MOONBEAM CITY. oh yeah and the two female characters discuss the bechdel test in a scene where they "pass" it - fuck off. </p><p>i'll end with this quote from a 10/10 review on imdb:</p><p>If you're a fan of The Big Bang Theory, don't bother with this film - you probably won't get the jokes as they are not spoon-fed to you and there's no canned laughter to tell you when to find things funny. If you like your jokes "Community-meta", give this movie a shot - you'll love it!</p><p>*if you search "deep" on shudder this comes up before DEEP RED </p><p>**also more of a whodunnit than KNIVES OUT, the classy cousin of this kinda crap</p>

<br><b>588: In The Shadow Of The Moon 2019</b>
<br><p>for like an hour or so this is a cool &amp; intriguing xfiles/terminator/trancers throwback cop movie - almost fincheresque! - til it becomes something way crappier and enraging</p><p>smug pig vibes right out the gate at the 1997 proto-blm protests where the nice white dad/cop tells his daughter "some people just wanna be angry" or some such condescending shit but turns out the movies p.o.v. is actually the too-common trump-era radical-centrist/status quo/middle-ground "what if we could erase all the weird/bad/crazy stuff and just go back to NORMAL AMERICA" worldview, as revealed by the hugely stupid twist - spoilers from here on out! - ok so years ago i had an idea for a low-budget thriller centered on a devils-rejects type home invasion based on the miles dyson family lynching in t2, which i always hated, but from the victims perspective &amp; without the context of us knowing killer time-travel robots actually exist, so just a deranged (possibly racist) heavily-armed mansonesque creep telling a family they gotta die to prevent a dystopian crime in the future, kept ambiguous &amp; plausibly weird enough that either interpretation (time travel or schizo) could be true right up til the end. this movie almost hints at that sorta kyle reese/serial killer ambiguity til they drop the ball completely and fully endorse the minority-report precog thought-crime vigilante doctrine in a way that feels like a libertarian parody of "what sjws actually believe" (dont read the wrong sorta books or a biracial feminist time-cop will be justified in shooting you in the face!!) with a big inspiring ending where the nice white pig (barf) realizes its necessary to blow the brains out of anybody who owns a shitty racist manifesto that would prob get published by adam parfey's feral house but will also def (?) inspire militia guys (?) to blow up a federal building. i ditched all my dumbass teenage anarcho/1st amendment absolutist views long ago &amp; gen. cosign euro-style laws against holocaust denial or nazism (the idea of speech bans a "slippery slope" meaningless in a country where we have no voice to begin with) but i def own (and read) weird, occasionally nefarious counterculture shit like loompanics anthologies or jack chick tracts that would 100% red-flag me for the thought-crime kill list of whatever utopian society this book-burning netflix copaganda thinks is desirable. this isnt anti-racist (the hero is a cop!) its anti-heretic &amp; landed on tim mcveigh domestic white terrorism as the fringe heresy that most good people would be on board with eliminating, like when columbine gave em an excuse to try &amp; ban DOOM (or uhh fbi v. trump). panthers, anti-fascists &amp; black bloc bikepunks smacking the shit outta cops, klansmen &amp; nazi marchers (or gettin em fired from professorships) is all good in my book but fantasizing about judge dredd conformity-police spacewarping into fashy nerds bedrooms to xxxterminate the antisocial "by any means necessary" before they can xerox "the turner diaries 2069: turn'n harder" is some bush-era "torture stops 9/11" jack bauer shit dressed up as woke for embarrassed suburban dems &amp; bloomberg voters who wanna Make America Sane Again</p>

<br><b>600: Wilson 2017</b>
<br><p>wow the most-anticipated indie dramedy rental of 1998 is here!! switch off mark mcguire hosting snl and lets fire this shit up!!!</p><p>theres an old issue of the comics journal with a looong dan clowes interview a couple years into 8ball where he talks about what movies he's seen lately and its--</p><p>CLOWES: The Player and Barton Fink, which are similar movies, and which I had the same objections to, in that they had some really good moments, which were generally the Hollywood moments, where they were doing this ruthless parody of what these individual guys had to go through as directors in Hollywood. But then they both had to couch their movies in these trappings of a mystery/crime plot, which seemed to me to be totally pointless. And Barton Fink had this supernatural serial killer guy who was shot down in a bunch of flames in the end, and all that stuff just really rubs me the wrong way. I mean, I wanted the whole thing to be about Hollywood, I didn't want to see this other stuff that seemed to be just a hook to capture the audience.</p><p>GROTH: Yeah, I'm dreading the day when you start getting compared to the Coen Brothers.</p><p>CLOWES: I'll blow my brains out at that point. I really thought there were some amazing scenes in that movie, of the Hollywood studio executive, and then all the stuff with John Goodman I found boring and trite and contrived. I thought The Player was a little better than that, but it still had to have the mystery plot to hook the audience.</p><p>-- and yeah wow haha turns out making movies is harder than it looks huh buddy??? his last one, art school confidential (which god help me i actually like) was a flatly-shot underwritten sadboy pining for unattainable hot teen blonde &amp; a bunch of sarcastic kevin smith nerds saying shit like "ok homo, heres the breakdown: there's the goths, the burnouts, thats the slackers, the preppies..." in a cafeteria, playing out the same kinda serial killer "mystery/crime plot" he shitted sidewayz on back in 92. this 24 yr old hipster thinks he can bust shots at robert altman just cuz he sketched some gen x pepsi cans and 3 issues of a lounge lizard parody??? i love indie comix &amp; some of my fav movies have that "indie comix" feel but im not sure indie comix actually work as movies, maybe cuz regular comic books are so inherently simplistic &amp; juvenile (a good thing!) that when they go realist &amp; dress em up w/ actual grownup topics (while still being comix or.... "graphic novels") they reap outsized love based on lowered expectations, which gets stripped away when translated to a serious/complex medium like "cinema" (yeah i know) where making superman depressed doesnt actually advance the art form. dan's recent sci-fi revenge book "patience" is pretty good, but its about as philosophical and profound as like, INNERSPACE, which i dont think gets called one of the finest-of-its-medium in new yorker critics lists. oh yeah and - this movie sucks! woody from cheers is all wrong, too imposing physically, reading dry/deadpan lines with cheap-seats wisecracker flair, so it all ends up way too sitcommy and.... hollywood. oh well! ok see you in 2021 for the flash-animated netflix ghost world reboot series (from the creators of "bojack")</p>

It is called blood pinning in the United States Marine Corps.[1] Although it is rare, some Air Force Academy cadets receive their upper-class Prop and Wings insignia via the blood wings tradition.[2]</p><p>Upon receiving the Parachutist Badge, an instructor or comrade of the graduate places the pins of the badge pointing into the chest of the graduate. The badge is then slammed against the graduate's chest, resulting in the pins being driven into the flesh. If the graduation is affiliated with a particular unit number (unit 15, for example), then the pin will often be pounded deeper into the muscle the same number of times (15 times in this case).</p><p>The origins of this tradition are unknown, but most likely date back to World War II paratrooper training. This practice is fairly secretive and sparked controversy recently when knowledge of it reached the public,[3] which is often critical about painful forms of hazing. Blood wings are against Armed Forces Policy and are prohibited.[4] Recipients of blood wings consider it a highly honorable rite of passage.[5]</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_wings" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_wings</a></p><p>*Jeff Burr - Dalton, Georgia.

(this CIA-imported coke help fuel the crack epidemic of the 1980s) In short, Bill and Hillary's Arkansas became nothing less than a narco-republic, with little banks near Mena laundering more money than the big banks in New York City'' </p><p>Dan Lasater: When he was aged 19, Lasater started a hamburger chain. He met Clinton's half-brother, Roger Clinton, at the racetrack. Lasater sold his hamburger chain and moved to Arkansas, then founded the Ponderosa Steakhouse, a nationwide chain of 650 family restaurants; started a bond trading firm; and nurtured his love for horseracing.[3] Over the next two years, the ties between Lasater and the Clintons grew stronger.</p><p>The Clintons benefited from the relationship. Lasater contributed money to the governor's campaign; lent Roger Clinton $8,000 to pay off a drug debt; sponsored fundraising parties at his offices; made his private plane available to the ambitious young governor for campaign jaunts; and encouraged his staff to donate to the governor's campaign, promising higher commissions to compensate for the donations, according to published reports. At one point in 1985, he also made his plane available to squire celebrities to a charity function organized by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p><p>Lasater benefited from the closer ties, too. In the summer of 1985, Clinton successfully lobbied the Arkansas legislature to approve a contract for Lasater to sell $30.2 million in bonds for the new state police radio system. The contract netted Lasater's firm $750,000, according to a report in The Los Angeles Times.[3]</p><p>In 1984, Dan Lasater bought a ski resort in New Mexico for $20 million and used Clinton's name (with permission) to promote it. Later, a US Customs investigative report will note that the resort is being used for drug trafficking and money laundering.[1]</p><p>Lasater stated "Roger came to me and said that he owed a drug dealer $8,000, and that the drug dealer had threatened him, his mother and his brother [Governor Clinton] if they didn't pay and wanted to know if I would loan him the money, and I did."[4]</p><p>In 1990, Lasater was pardoned by Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton after serving just six months in jail.[1]</p><p>In 1994, Gandy Baugh, an attorney who had represented Clinton buddy and drug distributor Dan Lasater, allegedly jumped to his death. Baugh's law partner committed suicide one month later.[1][5]</p><p>Years later, after the suspicious murder of her husband, Jane Parks, the resident manager of an expensive Little Rock apartment complex, would tell Ambrose Evans-Pritchard of the London Sunday Telegraph that during the summer of 1984 Roger Clinton had been a nonpaying guest there for two months. The governor was ‘a frequent visitor,’ the Telegraph reported. ‘There was drug use at those gatherings . . . and [Parks] could clearly distinguish Bill’s voice as he chatted with his brother about the quality of the marijuana they were smoking. She said she could also hear them talking about the cocaine as they passed it back and forth.’ ”</p><p>Clinton = CIA:</p><p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/clinton-was-cia-informer-as-student-new-book-claims-1.61558" rel="nofollow">www.irishtimes.com/news/clinton-was-cia-informer-as-student-new-book-claims-1.61558</a></p><p>His chief source made a record of Mr Clinton's listing within the CIA as an informant for "Operation Chaos" in the late 1960s. The CIA purged these files in the 1970s when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee investigated the agency's spying activities.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline104904_000.htm" rel="nofollow">www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010120/aponline104904_000.htm</a></p><p>In one of his final acts, President Clinton on Saturday pardoned more than 100 Americans, including former Whitewater business partner Susan McDougal, brother Roger Clinton and former CIA Director John Deutch, officials said.</p><p>The president granted clemency to Patty Hearst, the 1970s kidnap victim who later went to prison in connection with a bank robbery</p>

<br><p>shockingly bad! like just as a movie. i know theres hints of this characterization in the comix &amp; del toros but i'll never forgive them for turning hellboy into epic snark deadpool and its not even as dumb/entertaining as that sounds. joyless "forced fun" marvel movie vibe, real kingsman shit. lil peep didnt die for this!</p><p>no understanding of theology or mythology &amp; manages to be 1000x more reddit-atheist unfunny than hellboy 2 which actually had a character played by seth "what the deuce?" macfarlane. instead of a sad, frustrated old-timey monster, hellboy is now a quippy "sarcasm is my spirit animal" youtuber with zero! fucks! given! and a bunch of tired ADR one-liners added in post (whenever you cant see hellboys face be sure hes going "thats gonna leave a mark!" or "is this my uber?"). last line of the film, no bullshit, is "um, alright... THAT just happened..." </p><p>introduces like 800 boring characters who immediately disappear and it doesnt matter. feels like it was made by marketing guys cutting a whole season of a tv show into a confusing feature, or a spinoff from the 2nd of a trilogy where they keep cutting in scenes from the other 2, scorpion king style (nicest thing i can say is some of that reminded me of xena or ash vs evil dead but they dont get why that stuff is fun). anything halfway decent was stolen from the last 2 movies and everything else is awful. filled with corny post-white stripes handclappy millennial vest bluesrock youd hear in a tv ad for like, HelloFresh ("woaaah oh-oh-oh-OH-oh!") artless cgi gore and stupid looking NON-puppet monsters overanimated to look like some unfinished videogame shit - not even good paul w.s. anderson videogame shit (milla cant elevate this, tho shes by far the best thing in it). looks like its set in the world of the michael bay ninja turtles &amp; panders to suburban nerd "well played, sir" ron swanson funko guys but fails even at that. expects a laugh for saying "twitter"</p><p>add to the long list of 21st century flops seemingly inspired by - but totally in the shadow of - modern masterpiece YOUR HIGHNESS.</p>

<br><b>625: The Trick Or Treat Picture Show</b>
<br><p>i mean, its fine. this isnt a feature, its a collection of not-quite-horror shorts you'd see maybe at a student festival in greenville, south carolina - yknow, classy, boring ones shot on color-corrected digital with badly-mic'd yupsters drinking outta mason jars &amp; looking out the window, not pig-mask chicken-fucker torture shit made by petco asst.manager juggalos. theres also a bunch of public domain retro drive-in ads with the same 3 synthwave tracks playing over em (what does bandcamp cyberpunk muzak have to do with 50s drive-ins? what do either have to do with watching midnight frights on tv in the 80s?) cuz this is designed as a "halloween moodwatch" i guess, not far off from mr lobo's "cinema insomnia" on osi74 (the best) or one of andrew shearers gonzoriffic compendiums (these too), but nowhere near as fun. its all part of this movement of atmospheric VOD stuff designed to be enjoyed nostalgically like disposable television, which can be cool but still needs for some of the stuff to be actually good enough to pay attention to. the only segment that left a mark was a nice lil mockmentary abductee/occult short with some genuinely weird shit to contrast the period fetishism, but they undermine it by cutting into the suspense with "lets all go to the lobby" vaporwave shit every 5 minutes. oh this also has one of my fav things a non-cookbook can have - recipes!! after like an hour of blandness they show you how to make fun halloween shit like crescent roll wiener mummies and a veggie skeleton and it fucking rules! i always make sure my zines have recipes and games in em so i appreciated this part the most, which is kinda sad. aside from the cool recipes this is almost entirely without substance and the style isnt interesting or accurate enough to carry it but u may still find something cool in it for this halloweene season. ok time to go watch WNUF for the 40th time bye</p>

<br><p>"Having watched this live gore-a-thon, Challis is now 'awake'. He sees what the "big giveaway" will be. His face expresses what we feel when we first awaken to the New World Order conspiracy - shock, dread, and dismay. Cochran reveals his motive to Dr. Challis who he has tied to a chair. It's a witchcraft thing, and relates to the planets being in proper alignment. The bloodletting of the children and their parents shall be a ritual sacrifice to appease a wicked, otherworldly force. </p><p>It has been argued that the "terrorist" attacks of September 11, 2001 were a ritual blood sacrifice. Recall George W. Bush, the President at the time, was informed that 'America is under attack' as the events were transpiring, while he sat in a Florida classroom during a demonstration of a new reading program. The demonstration was filmed. The book in his hands was titled "The Pet Goat." The teacher tapped rhythmically on an easel with a writing instrument (a magic wand?) as the children in the classroom pronounced a string of words in unison, including "Planes," "Must," "Hit," "Steel,". Then the children all bowed down to remove the books beneath their seats. </p><p>Before Betty Kumpfer fell victim to the slithery-crawlies in 'Test Room A', she told her husband, "I think this whole thing is a big joke. I mean, look at this," picking up fake fruit from a fruit bowl set upon the coffee table and laughing. Similarly, Cochran tells Dr. Challis that beyond being a blood sacrifice, his wretched scheme is a "joke on the children." Could 9/11 likewise have been a huge joke played on the children?"</p><p>- Randy Cunningham, Season of the New World Order: The Halloween 3 - Illuminati Connection</p>


<br><b>629: Trick Or Treat 1986</b>
<br><p>first time watch! this was so good id be down for a p.m.r.c./satanic-panic coming-of-age drama about these characters with zero supernatural or horror elements, even tho sammi curr makes a killer <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/nightmare-feddy-the-complete-encyclofredia/" rel="nofollow">nightmare feddy</a> addition to the gang of electricity-powered villains alongside horace pinker, the trickster, the scolari bros, the voicemail gremlin in gremlins 2, the raiden guy from big trouble in little china, and ernest after charles napier sends him to the electric chair. he really feels like a real, vital phenomenon in a way i usually never buy in movies like this (he also gets pulled into a toilet, in what i like to call the 'reverse ghoulie'). the teen who stans him ("RAGMAN") is perfect too - genuine, trusting, not too preppy or bland to play a bullied sarcastic metalhead but not mean or actorly-unpleasant enough to lack naivete - just a shy loser teenager. his milhousian junior accountant bestie is the sole acting credit for glen morgan of xfiles/black xmas/final destination fame, who ran what is prob my fav television season of all time (millennium season 2, inc its classic halloween ep). id always heard this was great &amp; know a ton of ppl who loved it/grew up with it but my $3 dvd has such a heinously shitty cover* i still went in with low enough expectations that it blew me away - recommended!

<br><b>634: Blood Dolls</b>
<br><p>holy shit thats more like it!! this absurd misanthropic full moon masterpiece manages to combine the genres of legal/business drama, sado-masochist erotic thriller, southern gothic soap opera, wry existential tragedy, class-conscious social satire &amp; still be a tiny killer doll slasher that's better than 4/5ths of the puppet masters. the first 10 minutes has the villain explaining "i myself am, of course, a racist" in a series of developments that culminates in maybe the funniest reveal of any charles band film - my jaw was on the floor. everybody in this cruel farce is evil, but the bad guy who's also, or course, a racist is "virgil travis", the role of a lifetime for kristopher logan (aka "jack maturin"??) a full moon vet who played the himmleresque nazi dork leech woman kills in p.m.3 and was last seen as "old man" in netflix hit bird box and multiple episodes of something called "youtube: the musical". after seeing the tease of his mask reveal in the trailer 1000 times (on a LOT of videos i own) i wouldnt dream of spoiling that he looks like a (!!!EXTREME SPOILERS!!!!) nugget-headed tim heidecker as zitty garbage pail kid in one of the suits from kanye &amp; lil pump's "i love it" vid (!!spoilers....). virgil's corporate rival is a dopey business guy named "harris yulin" (like the actor? why?? did he turn down a puppet master?? is this legal?) secretly controlled by his scheming dominatrix wife, the dearly departed debra mayer (voodoo academy, hell asylum, toby keith's "how do you like me now" music video) in her feature film debut. mayer's campy moira has a great time taunting &amp; nippleclamping her doofus spouse while saying shit like "is there anything in this world more pathetic than a man? i think not" and holding her own against virgil &amp; the actor portraying him - they're both performances you'd show someone doubting you can find genuine theatrical talent &amp; flair in a shitty z-movie. acidic class commentary exposing the twisted machinations of perverted billionaires feels more topical than ever, tho im sure somebody like band has seen worse shit in real life. this whole passionate burlesque of treachery &amp; double-crosses becomes kinda like full moon's millers crossing, with clown-faced butler/henchman/religious advisor "MISTER MASCARO" - in the same makeup as jack attack from demonic toys (!) and the 2019 joker (!!!) - even reminding me of stoic hitman eddie dane, tho the coen bros would never include some shit like virgil's dreamy all-woman pet rock band (including girlfriends' persia white), which actually sound like some shit i wouldve listened to in 1999 in between portishead and c-murder's LIFE OR DEATH. theres so much going on i cant even mention nicolas worth (darkman's pauly!) or the immortal phil fondacaro (underused, but still nice to see <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/phil-fondacaro-the-empire-full-moon-films/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/list/phil-fondacaro-the-empire-full-moon-films/</a> ) cuz the real draw here isnt spot-the-actor cameos or gore fx, its the naked philosophic/confessional vibe that elevates it above something like HEAD OF THE FAMILY. so what's inside charles band's brain? well, it's cynical &amp; melancholy, with a running theme of masks &amp; identity, how duplicity can both conceal and divulge our true selves, from virgil's phantom creep facade to mister mascaro removing his clown makeup to use his actual face as a disguise. you even get a taste of charlie's religious beliefs - in a movie obsessed with surveillance, wiretapping &amp; espionage, mister mascaro performs a wedding (!) - he's ordained in the "church of the divine spirit" - appealing to a deity that "totally permeates the entire universe - wheresoever you may be, you cant get away...". we all wear masks &amp; hide our true selves, but god sees &amp; knows all. this is charles band removing his mask, praying to be loved &amp; understood. is that so much to ask?</p><p>"the pit yawns before me. i, of all living creatures, can permit myself no illusion of a soul. it is from emptiness that i came, and that emptiness awaits me at the end, and what dwells between is but a mad, pointless puppet show, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing" - charlie band writing as "robert talbot" in his original screenplay for blood dolls</p><p>also essential is ltopomcfly's read on this being about band's divorce here: <a href="https://letterboxd.com/ltopomcfly/film/blood-dolls/1/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/ltopomcfly/film/blood-dolls/1/</a></p>

(they do treat the multiple gay characters way better than passion of the crust, where the makeup guy gets a hair-curler in the ass and likes it). after the opening flashback at a suburban fake myers house ("halloween: 1978," groan) attempts some vague, cloudy sense of mood i was sorta impressed to see them actually giving a shit about the dumb witchboard premise then BAM! you get a classic richard band theme that couldve been one of his 80s bangers (the rest is scored by danny "draven"s wife &amp; blue man group member "jojo draven", who also did dave decoteau's RING OF DARKNESS and i just learned is in "the world's only female tribute to iron maiden" IRON MAIDENS) but then the movie starts and we're back to generic EDM rap ("i like to smoke / i like to drink" actual lyric) playing over the same bullshit single-location stock footage party montage youve seen from bando 80 times before (this ends with a stamp proudly touting "full moon #332," jesus christ). i laughed out loud more than a few times at some of the ass-covering dialogue that seemed like it was getting made up on the spot, like when decoteau's easter bunny puppy goes "you prob noticed im not the puppy on the poster... well.... dont worry about it!!" - we're talkin killer eye: halloween haunt-level meta here! there's a scene where somebody asks for rolling papers and its NOT product placement! ooga booga, hold ya head!</p><p>here's the thing (end spoilers): this is dedicated to john carl buechler and ends with a pic of him w/ the ghoulies right after the ragga ghost says HAPPY HALLOWEEN to the camera. does anything else matter??? xoxo yr pal, DemonWarrior13</p>

<br><b>644: Carver 2015</b>
<br><p>super high kill-count seasonal slasher with shogun assassin style blood spurts and tons of goofy, irrepressible halloween spirit. the way this movie earnestly cares about teenage shit like friends and crushes and high school football makes it so much richer than shallow exercises like halloween '18, beyond the novelty of being written &amp; directed by a 14 yr old. super charming &amp; entertaining, obv not for fans of big budgets &amp; technical wizardry but if u enjoy fun s.o.v. hangouts or have ever watched an alex disanto movie this captures whats good about the 80s stuff on a deep level without any pandering, superficial gimmicks - its one of the most enjoyable modern slashers (and halloween watches) i could recommend. streaming on pr*me!</p>

<br><b>647: Knife Heart</b>
<br><p>was skeptical going in but this is the real deal - despite general dicklessness theres a charged sweetness to all the cum'n'tanlines hookups &amp; our homo-artcore directrix vanessa paradis has a real tragic sense of humor &amp; cynical intelligence i didnt expect from someone i last saw in YOGA HOSERS. introducing her bottom-out drunk &amp; dumped by her gf over a payphone had me locked in right out the gate! love how they offset the horny sex murders &amp; prerequisite red/blue neon synth with some of the supernatural fairy tale/mystery elements from so many messy 70s euro-horrors everybody seems to forget about now. Watch This Gay Giallo Now!!</p>
<br><b>648: Final Stab</b>
<br><p>"im gonna call kristin and see if its ok to just splash some blood on myself and call it a day" (dave decoteau splashes some blood on him and calls it a day)</p><p>super enjoyable cheapo slasher with great catty dialogue - esp. "queen bitch of deception" erinn carter, one of dave's best actor discoveries - &amp; a hilariously convoluted plot, all shot in dave's petey pablo-era seasick/rock-the-boat style with a bunch of ab-washing 1313-worthy hunks saying the word "gazebo" more times than i have my entire life (watch for the one guy who pronounces it "gah-zay-bo") led by SHRIEKER's tom cruise-alike jamie gannon who shot this while working as a p.a. on todd solondz's STORYTELLING. has a shockingly good thriller score (from KILLER KLOWNS composer john massari) that reminded me of some of the cues from depalma's mission impossible, no bullshit. im glad ive lived long enough that early 2000s scream-ripoff slashers have the same nostalgic perks 80s slashers did for the people actually IN early 2000s scream ripoffs (plz read this while wearing a beige vest &amp; huge cargo pants). also secretly a halloween movie (the holiday, not the series) &amp; aka "final scream", lol</p>


<br><b>649: The Dark Backward</b>
<br><p>normal people get annoyed at movies like this &amp; rob zombies cuz theyre made by sensitive weirdos with depression who know how obnoxious &amp; ugly the world really can be/is. somebody plz trace the origins of marty malt (1991) thru ripoffs neil hamburger (1992) and joey mccobb from eightball #11 (1993)</p>
<br><b>650: The Furies 2019</b>
<br><p>wow its 2005 again and piss-colored torture shit is BACK for netflix'z elevated-horror kids who say actors are "casted"! this sub-platinum dunes aussie crap is so 00s its even got the (spoilers) webcam/V.R./surveillance most-dangerous-game/battle-royale twist* and a bunch of overdesigned halloween-store slipknot cosplay guys who'd look played out at a local "haunt." its trendy/pretentious letterboxd description ("A gripping female-driven horror film (...) burrows into universal themes of survival, revenge and redemption and reveals the darkness lurking within us all" lmao) fronts like its some kinda stupid #metoo metaphor for women standing by abusive men instead of sticking with each other, OR is that a thin excuse for making this kinda crappy chick-mutilation movie in 2019??? who fucking cares! its funny how "slasher fans" get treated like sadistic/bloodthirsty faces-of-death psychos when most of em i know would rather watch a corny 80s jason or sleepaway camp sequel with all the gore cut to pg13 and 95% of it just girls with big hair playing spin the bottle over any of these gooey, underlit, pandering wannabes like HATCHET v BLOODSKULL VI: KANE HODDER BUYS A FORD EXPLORER or what the fuck ever. sadly this prob wouldve been fun to watch with a 2005 dumb multiplex audience of dudes wearing south park tees with cartman's saying "osama killed kenny! you bastards!" instead of in laid out on my couch in 2019 streaming off the shudder roku app but slashers dont get theatrical releases anymore. in conclusion this shouldve been called THE FURRIES and everybody gets yiffed to death. ok bye *<a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/film/slave-girls-from-beyond-infinity/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/film/slave-girls-from-beyond-infinity/</a></p>

<br><p>"transylvania... where the words 'you suck' are a compliment"</p><p>this ocktoberwatch gets love just for bobby "boris" pickett (who wrote the screenplay! alongside 2 arsenio hall vets) doing that voice for 81 minutes and his igor - john kassir, the cryptkeeper himself - doing basically THAT voice for 81 minutes, but its gonna depend alot on your strength to endure some bad jokes &amp; very bad songs. its all real stagey so not surprised it was based on bobby's mid 60s live show and feels like a dumb kiddy tv movie which apparently played in what id imagine were mostly empty theaters, scattered with fun "weekend" grandmas wincing at bad 90s sex jokes. what should be the big showstopper, pickett finally singing the MONSTER MASH! plays out awkwardly in a tiny, cramped dining room with everyone just sitting around uncomfortably, which makes sense considering it wasnt in the original musical. the rocky horror wannabe plot and sitcom-ugly staging dont play out as well as the little moments like cryptkeeper kassir's fez-wearing hunchback doing a pro-deformity number that ends with him in a top hat and tails singing "move over, donald hump!!" horror legend candace cameron (NIGHTSCREAM*, VISITORS OF THE NIGHT, I SAW WHAT YOU DID, the ALF DOLL COMMERCIAL) stars alongside elsa toulon herself sarah douglas (as a bitchy vampire bride) and some monster mash flygirls to do the monster mash background vocals</p><p>extra half star for the meters "cissy strut" needledrop every time jimmy "j.j." walker shows up as the manager/pimp of an elvis mummy (played by the impersonator from munchie strikes back), half star off for playing an oriental gong riff when candace cameron &amp; john kassir both yell "soon yi!"

<br><b>663: Robot Monster</b>
<br><p>i cannot. yet i must.</p><p>true ro-mance</p>
<br><b>664: Operation Avalanche</b>
<br><p>like the (alleged) landing itself, this is an impressive technical achievement that doesnt actually accomplish anything of benefit or substance. the shot-on-16mm (??) footage looks great and theres not too many anachronistic details but it def needed another pass in the writers room to be more than just a clever premise. the bitchy, passive-aggressive yet still likable &amp; heroic CIA agents occasionally make this feel like a retro episode of "the office" (why do american guys say "sorey"?) and the corny scene where they come up with "one small step for man" feels like forrest gump or one of the "easter eggs" from a marvel movie ("hey, i know that!"). the whole thing plays into the ironic/aesthetic conspiracy mode right down to the seinfeld-quoting tagline, which means its prob disinfo: there are 2 real, on-record missions called "operation avalanche" - a 2003 military op in afghanistan and the 2001 "largest in history" child porn investigation that snagged 1000s of people - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2445065.stm" rel="nofollow">news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2445065.stm</a> - so anybody wanting to misdirect research to some counterfactual flat-earth hipster shit would love it if you lookup [actor name] + "operation avalanche" &amp; get 10 pages of results for a film festival mumblecore comedy instead of the molestation bust (covert ops frequently use acronyms like IRS or USAID making them impossible to google or cross-ref in the old mae brussell card catalog era). wondered where they got the $$ to license "bad moon rising" but its produced/distro'd by the state-dept's fake counterculture propaganda rag VICE, of course</p>


<br><b>665: Allan Quatermain And The Lost City Of Gold</b>
<br><p>"i looove goooold!" - goldmember</p><p>kinda like an adaptation of the golden axe sega games with richard chamberlain's allan (i know its from a book but how hilarious is it to have an indiana jones ripoff named "allan"??) searching for a diff lost city of gold than dora the explorer was last month. he plays the quater mane like a cross between riker &amp; richard branson (as a bored kid i did NOT know chamberlain was gay irl &amp; fuckin the guy who plays his lil brother) while henry silva is yet another ethnicity that may not even exist and elvira doesnt have any lines. after star wars james earl jones prob asked lucas if he could do raiders of the lost ark and ended up having to slum it in cannon's racist knockoff instead but looks like hes having fun regardless. sharon stone is good in everything. you can do a lot worse!</p>


<br><b>666: Itsy Bitsy</b>
<br><p>(lame nerd voice) heh, yeah, its a "killer spider movie" but, like, its actually serious and WELL-DONE... you know, psychological horror? yes this hose is for sniffing my farts why do u ask (gasping, wheezy huffing &amp; sucking noises trying to do air quotes while saying "killer spider movie")</p><p>this is mostly annoying, cutesy indie movie kid drama &amp; drab, self-serious dtv-horror tedium mixed w/ some good creature puppeteering &amp; RETIRED ARCHAEOLOGIST BRUCE DAVISON! but the drawn-out pace is a drag &amp; its determined to have absolutely no fun with the the premise, even fucking up the chance for a perfect comedy gore/food cut (bathroom kill/egg breakfast). the mom eventually (spoilers) punches the spider puppet &amp; i guess it was fun noticing how much tasha yar - who literally has no character or plot function - looks like hillary clinton now but this is mostly dreary, tiresome &amp; also racist. dont bother!</p>


<br><b>667: Slaughter Party</b>
<br><p>surprisingly artful for a dwarf slasher with a ron jeremy disembowelling. like most 21st century troma lloyd fills this with bar-band pop punk and.... ska-rap? but for like 20 seconds theres a gravediggaz "diary of a madman" ripoff and the whole thing has a singular vibe &amp; intent, w/ cormanesque showman's zeal most of these lack. trash plopped in the brain damage/subrosa gorezone, fans of ryan cavalline, rejoice &amp; be glad in it</p>

<br><b>670: Midnight Strangers</b>
<br><p>had to add this weird 70s (?) greek (??) vhs i dug up in an antique mall cuz apparently its some kinda long-lost media repackaged as a cheap 90s erotic thriller &amp; searching the title/director/writer on here got me nothing. i expected a kinda giallo-y hangout from the opening blast of poliziotteschean progfunk, and while this approaches some of the euro fetishism of bruno/helene's eroticized bods &amp; textures in LET THE CORPSES TAN it evolves beyond misty emmanuelle clone to become a more tragic melodrama/women's picture, like fassbinder for idiots - a fateful series of soapy baths, awkward, self-hating hookups and conversations about money in rooms with wood paneling. its all carried by the bravura lead performance (even thru the dubbing!) from anna fonsou, who spends the latter half of the movie in a twizzler-colored coat that makes her look like eddie murphy in delirious. imdb tells me fonsou "(s)hocked Greek audiences in the seventies with her nude, erotic scenes in a handful of softcore movies" and this def qualifies - my tape sez UNRATED but some of it feels edited down from a sleazier hardcore feature and all the jarring rifts &amp; cuts of flesh, sex &amp; memories just add to the themes of repressed adult trauma. theres also some hellenic class conflict at a bitchy dinner party where fonsou's streetwalking elena is caught between a bisexual football (soccer) player and a guy who looks like john saxon playing johnny cash, seized in the cloudy video smear of 70s avocado interiors. sure its "problematic" to tell the tale of a bewitching hooker who meets a bad end but this thankfully focuses on our fucked up patriarchal society instead of shaming or moralizing, and the "bad end" really builds to something unsettling, violent &amp; freudian &amp; hits a kaleidoscopic bava vibe of the psychological/subconscious surreal. somebody tell me what the fuck is this movie &amp; get vinegar syndrome to drop it on datpiff.com right now!!!!!!</p>

<br><p>wow i had a pretty good time with this fox family 13 nights of halloween-ass movie half-directed by david decoteau! imdb sez he quit 4 days in (a full production schedule for him) but the cast of non-threatening prettyboys &amp; short kings obsessed with "male size" ("i gotta grow a few inches!") and a teen dreamboat lead (somehow NOT jason marsden) worried hes gonna end up in "someone's small intestine" has dave's fingerprints all over it (hopefully not literally)</p><p>like most decoteau movies the women are having the most fun, from a neuromancer-quoting loft-dweller hacker girl who goes to babylon 5 conventions and calls her pw-protected factory loft (which has a KRAA THE SEA MONSTER poster) "the matrix" (heart eyes emoji) to full moon's dearly departed debra mayer (VOODOO ACADEMY, GINGERDEAD MAN, CRYPTZ) as drag-inspired mad scientist "doctor krackel", cartoonishly threatening hacker girl with tapes of a blossom marathon</p><p>ive seen a bunch of these* &amp; this is one of the better non-horror moonbeams.... its no SPOOKYTOWN but a million times better than some shit like EXCALIBUR KID</p><p>*<a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/charles-bands-moonbeam-empire/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/list/charles-bands-moonbeam-empire/</a></p>

<br><p>i declare the snake an Honorary Ghoulie</p>
<br><b>676: Ai 187</b>
<br><p>ok i knew this would (ironically) be dumb as shit but what am i gonna do, not watch a dumped-on-prime sci-fi bomb with title that looks like my name &amp; a poster with lance henriksen doing the ?quieries? meme* *<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oaW1frpSSQQ/hqdefault.jpg" rel="nofollow">i.ytimg.com/vi/oaW1frpSSQQ/hqdefault.jpg</a> ??</p><p>i actually kinda love the ugly cd-rom screensaver unreality of this, like the techno dreamscapes of DESPISER or THE AMAZING BULK crossed with RETURN TO ZORK &amp; a greenscreened mtv movie awards parody sketch - it kinda works for board-room interiors but when theyre on a blurry pier at sunset its almost nauseating. honestly no clue what the whole fake deep concept is about (i think its kinda like a shittier version of blumhouse's upgrade? the genius microchip is actually "i.c. 187"???) but mostly its business guys staring out of high-rise windows saying "i am become death, destroyer of worlds..." like something outta that last hellraiser movie (".... charles dickens..."). lotsa turgid dystopian stuff dumb guys think is smart, superficial, wiki-skimmed refs to the apollo program &amp; manhattan project and a scene where somebody proves they have a 165 i.q. cuz they "just had a thesis published in TIME MAGAZINE" (???)</p><p>on the other hand, theres a part where lance henriksen says "freakin'..." &amp; a cameo from MARC SINGER, who looks exactly like gary cole now - its pretty cool for a while til the 2nd half where all the interesting(-ish) philosophizing older actors get replaced with bland action twinks led by a boyish dweeb with a chinstrap who does the whole macgruber "guns are for the weak... guns are for the stupid..." thing: "i thought we were a think tank... guns arent for thinking..."! anyway this is really bad &amp; also pretty watchable even tho it feels a.i./pd 187 minutes long so</p>


<br><b>677: 68 Kill</b>
<br><p>trent "i'm killjoy!" haaga's idea for a movie with increasingly desperate &amp; violent stakes was better when it was "broke losers debased by rich asshole" (CHEAP THRILLS) &amp; not this after-hours bitchez b.crazy pixie dream hooker shit.. but i love action/crime movies with sicko horror elements and the best of this is really funny &amp; fresh &amp; exciting while the worst feels like - you guessed it - s. craig zahler! especially how the "real life" tough breaks feel bland &amp; unconvincing at its weakest moments and oh yeah also all the "who, me?" plausibly deniable bigotry - in this case, coy misogyny. im not crazy about matthew gray gubler, whose name sounds like a madballs ripoff youd buy at the drugstore &amp; looks like a skinless, unseasoned walton goggins - his passive softboy protagonist spends most of the movie getting good boy points for not being a complete piece of shit which is always the most dull &amp; gutless possible choice to make with a character &amp; you can tell trent "give killjoy some sugar!" haaga thinks this wimpy dork is the kinda nice guy he REALLY is after he sponges off the greasepaint. still, anybody who knows me knows i love movies that give a shit about money the way real people do (1 of the best things is making the huge life-changing payoff be $68,000) this one's sloppy, sitcommy devil's rejects vibe never gets boring or pretentious so i guess i gotta say check it out dummies</p>


<br><b>678: Relentless</b>
<br><p>this shit is so good!! i love seeing flashbacks to a kid in strict, abusive survivalist training and instead of forging a cool unstoppable badass like it would in any other movie the guy just grows up to be a broken psychopath. judd is a perfect creep while one-good-cop leo rossi looks exactly like johnny tightlips from simpsons (his boss is ron "bleeding gums murphy" taylor) and his partner is fucking robert loggia!!! the blackgloved giallo-american-style plot feels like an oddball manhunter riff with its own weirdo tone and a [SPOILERS] friday the 13th pt 2 style freudian twist. lustig's run of cynical 80s blue-lives-murder flicks continue to be almost as good as larry cohen (this one's a lil mini MANIAC COP 2 reunion) and theres a great sick joke final shot. recommended!!!</p>


<br><b>679: Gas S S S</b>
<br><p>the opening 3rd of this feels as rich &amp; funny/intricate as pynchon but then like every other hippie movie it turns into a bunch of guys in army helmets riding around in dune buggies</p>

COOPER) shows up for like 5 min on a fake battleship wearing a baggy "naval admiral" costume (evoking his performance as "general bukkake" in WADZILLA) &amp; buddy holly nerd glasses, yelling into a phone &amp; looking a lot like (current) jane fonda. personal worst of 2019 so far</p>

RECOMMENDED!!!</p><p>also [SPOILERS] this has the same ending as midsommar</p><p>*<a href="https://letterboxd.com/production-design/william-cameron-menzies/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/production-design/william-cameron-menzies/</a></p>


<br><b>686: Robo Warriors</b>
<br><p>feels good to complete the trilogy - til i found this tape there was a ROBO WARRIORS-shaped hole in my heart i didn't know existed. they kept talking about going on the "infoweb" and every time i thought they were saying INFOWARS. "paul fusco" gets listed doing puppet fx in the end credits but NOT on imdb - gotta be the alf guy, right?</p>
<br><b>687: Dont Tell Her Its Me</b>
<br><p>unrealistic, unappealing, unfunny &amp; racist romantic "comedy" without anything to recommend beyond some weird gutenberg makeup fx, a briefly-glimpsed romance novelist convention straight outta SHE DEVIL, kyle maclachlan's lesbian body language, nice charleston s.c. photography, and shelley long's oafish goon of a 3 yr old daughter who she has to keep stopping from licking electrical outlets &amp; drinking poison. this movie is dogshit.</p>

<br><p>ladies &amp; gentlemen the afropunk/adultswim 'MOVIE 43' has arrived! </p><p>a.k.a. Garbage Pail Adults</p><p>i pray this enlarges the minds of hypebeast kids who havent watched 8000 hours of fucked up body-horror like me/everybody else on here but i thought it was a mixed bag that only occasionally worked - i like seeing black art &amp; artists/sensibilities in the usually white world of plotless experimental/installation film, and i like seeing flylo go hostile &amp; nauseating to push back on his rep as lo-fi hip-hop anime chill beats to relax and study to, but only about half the bits capture the anxious porn-y/splatter apocalyptic/nightmare aura instead of just being weird for weird's sake like a skittles ad. most of it feels like some shit i wouldve been obsessed with after seeing on mtv's AMP back n the day (its def a movie made by an artist signed to warp records) but sometimes the dingy brown art direction starts to feel like a tool video or 90s terry gilliam (how are vintage tube tvs and radios STILL in this kinda thing??) while also feeling like its launching a clothing line i cant afford, a lil too slick to be legit as it thinks. </p><p>its at its freshest when its leaning into the vine/tiktok comedy/ytp/spongebob meme sensibility (i def heard flylo ask for a krabby patty at the dr office) instead of just screaming ABORTION! RAPE! CUM! like a try-hard - alot of the grossout shocks would mean so much more if they were using sparingly in a plain ol boring narrative. i kept thinking of henelotter's immortal, also rapper-adjacent BAD BIOLOGY, which feels like kiarostami compared to this. sporadically overcomes the lazy ofwgkta skate/stoner vibe to approach real sicko horrorcore demon ish but then tim heidecker shows up doing his predictable smirky shtick as a rapist and its.......... not good. the gore/creature fx are better-than-expected for something this weird but could've used the surrealistic imagination of a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/screaming-mad-george/" rel="nofollow">SCREAMING MAD GEORGE</a> or...something idk. look i cant stress enough if this was a kid606 video shown after liquid television at 2am or a 90s "art" cd-rom i discovered as a teen itd be a whole new ballgame but i just wanted MORE weirdo dunce pinhead child feeding shit to a big butthole in the woods while a track off SAW II plays and less corporate [as]/collegehumor style "medical infomercial with fake vhs scanlines" shit that got played out around 2011. i'll def be checking out the next one tho!</p><p>also whoever did the captions for shudder gives the nword a hard R for black characters but not when a white woman says it??? wtf</p>


<br><b>694: Mirage Men</b>
<br><p>wanna storm area 51? back when this came out i remember thinking it was good but a lil' dry/inconclusive - obv i wanted more fun saucer wackadoos &amp; fewer depressing realizations about feds pushing the "extraterrestrial hypothesis" - but having now seen approx 80000 shittier versions of this kinda thing on pr1me/y0utub3/roku UFOTV channel* i know MIRAGE MEN is one of the best ufo docs ever made</p><p>and yeah its hard to accept the 90s mufon/disclosure/"cosmic watergate" scene was all military intel posing as whistleblowers, guys like john lear who i loved hearing on coast to coast "former" ("""""") pentagon/natsec assets pushing disinfo to mislead curious types into blind alleys. rick doty the psyop chipmunk - one of the oddest looking people ive ever seen in a movie, and im a fan of robert zdar - is the main focus here, and comes to admit all this in a roundabout sort of way, raising the question of how &amp; why hes in this doc to begin with. is this another stage of disinfo? should we trust him?? i dont know!!</p><p>i do believe there's valid psychic/metaspiritual aspects to the phenomenon but ever since ww2 (nazis &amp; allies chasing foo fighters) the development of the "saucer craze" has been a cover story for u.s. war-machines doing secret ops in enemy airspace, esp. using classified/experimental tech, credible "sightings" on radar (stealth) or aircraft that seem fantastical &amp; only get revealed decades later. even checkout rags like popular science admit this!** in the 90s we got the military testing robotic drones domestically, years before 9/11 allowed their implementation in iraq &amp; afghanistan - the same decade that "coincidentally" pushed a wave of extraterrestrial media from independence day to alien workshop skate tees, all now making a comeback as part of the weird 90s cult mall revival nostalgia trip (&amp; every moment captured by cameraphones 24/7 while we get less footage than the 50s). when people who dont trust the govt see the lights of an unmanned surveillance drone mosquito-buzzing their house after midnight, theyve been trained by movies to think like fox mulder &amp; assume its the big-eyed greys "they" cover up, not "they" themselves. hire a weirdo like bob lazar to do contract work in a defense lab for 6 months &amp; you can pump his head full of enough flashy roswell conspiracy crap to have him propagandizing "alien tech" for decades</p><p>this is the definition of a limited hangout- the revelation of just enough info to muddle &amp; confuse, 'disclosure' to prevent us from uncovering more important shit while establishing radical truthseeker cred of the (compromised) discloser (see: wikileaks, snowden, manning, ellsberg, etc). we can prove the pentagon deliberately leaks fake national secrets, so if people already know about area 51, why not make it something fun &amp; frivolous?</p><p>covering up spy planes to beat the commies may sound innocuous to yr average freedom-loving american but the more sinister side of this, especially with "abduction" psychology, is the hijacking of real, strange experiences to exploit &amp; victimize. what defines an experience? jacques vallee (the basis for truffaut's character in close encounters, which sold this myth better than anything) says the characteristic feature of a ufo experience is a "constant factor of absurdity that leads to a rejection of the story by the upper layers of the target society, and an absorption at a deep unconscious level of the symbols conveyed by the encounter." ufos represent a kind of "media virus" that replicates in pop-consciousness bcz it has a sticky, countercultural shell, dreamed up by psych docs at the stanford research institute &amp; released into the general public alongside new age individualist spirituality &amp; "satanic panic" kidnappings. the soviet union considered the proliferation of 70s ufo cults to be "provocateurs flirting with superstitions and religious impulses, directly or indirectly manipulated by the pentagon." once they establish the belief, you have the basis for understanding "abductions" (medical experiments/trafficking), as theorized by martin cannon:</p><blockquote><p>"How do we account for these tales carried out in conjunction with the military? I, for one, cannot credit the generally unsubstantiated tales of "cosmic conspiracy" now promulgated by ex- intelligence agents such as John Lear and William Cooper. While I cannot assert insincerity on the part of these men, I often wonder if they have been used as conduits -- witting or unwitting -- in a sophisticated disinformation scheme."</p><p>"A simpler, though no less chilling, explanation for the "base" abductions may be found in the story of Dr. Louis Jolyon West, now notorious for his participation in MKULTRA experiments with LSD. Inspired by VIOLENCE AND THE BRAIN (a book by Drs. Frank Ervin and Vernon H. Mark which ascribed inner city turmoil to a "genetic defect" within rebellious blacks), West proposed, in 1973, a "Center for the Study and Reduction of Violence", where potentially violent individuals could be dealt with prophylactically."</p><p>"And who were these individuals? According to West's proposal, the noteworthy factors indicating a violent predisposition were "sex (male), age (youthful), ethnicity (black) and urbanicity." How to deal with them? "...by implanting tiny electrodes deep within the brain, electrical activity can be followed in areas that cannot be measured from the surface of the scalp...it is even possible to record bioelectrical changes in the brains of freely-moving subjects, through the use of remote monitoring techniques..." By monitoring the subjects' EEGs remotely, potentially violent episodes could be identified."</p><p>(THE CONTROLLERS: A New Hypothesis of Alien Abduction)****</p></blockquote><p>now 2019: the pentagon has been screaming about ufos to anyone who'll listen***** with everybody treating it as fun kitsch (omg just like xfiles!) or a whoopsy secret the feds accidentally cant stop revealing, instead of deliberate, weaponized propaganda. all the goofy mk-ultra memes &amp; openly-disclosed "bumbling CIA" plans to mail fidel castro a bomb with a wig &amp; lipstick or whatever are designed to induce the same kind of pacifying, docile superiority as sneering at dubya gaffes or trump typos - wow our crazy, unsophisticated ruling class lacks the common sense to not keep goofing up &amp; doing weird, impractical stuff! theyre so naive!!</p><p>this is why the ufo myth gets promoted by both clintons****** &amp; their chief of staff podesta******* (deep in the ufology game) and how you get top secret bases namedropped by obama while honoring saucer-nut shirley maclaine ("i think i just became the first president to acknowledge area 51"). you think this is how it works when the govt is TRYING to keep a secret? cia director h.w. bush winked cute hints like "you dont know the half of it" while president carter actually reported a sighting; reagan insisted he expected an invasion to "bring the world together," a concept also exploited by nazi rocket scientist wernher von braun. presidents, nazis &amp; spies engaging in this kind of sci-fi pop philosophizing has the dual purpose of redirecting govt criticism &amp; skepticism into fantasy while flattening "conspiracy theorists" as romantic goofs who wanna smoke blunts with E.T. at "area 51" (which is a fun s.f. movie thing and NOT a genocide factory) that way when you start talking "secret military bases" or "CIA mind control programs" you sound like one of the crazy lizard people weirdos. that's the trick: when we start finding shit out, leak things that sound intriguing but are ultimately harmless &amp; absurd. its how you get headlines like the guardian's "Conspiracy theorists who wonder about aliens at Roswell and Nasa faking the moon landings have a new issue to ponder: did the CIA murder Hugo Chávez?"********. </p><p>this goes back to something we've talked about on here lately regarding shit like "under the silver lake" - the postmodern-ironic alien/ufo aesthetic represents another misdirection in the toolbox of libertarian conspiracy pranksters like robt anton wilson or subgenius, the exact opposite of pynchon, craig baldwin or "they live" who use this stuff as metaphor to put you on the right track. (RAW's "prometheus rising" fumbles to get ahead of the vallee theory proposing that while saucers could be appropriated for propaganda theyre "real" entities and its too simplistic/not fun enough to blame uncle sam). i dont know if "lets storm area 51" is a psyop created in the CIA tiktok-meme lab but it encourages such a warped idea of engagement, activism &amp; government mealfeasance that it might as well be - if it didnt exist, theyd have to invent it.********* and there's a real thing here, something beyond manipulation, that we cant lose sight of. between this and ESP/remote viewing im determinated to not let propaganda claim EVERYTHING from the spirit realm - if they take sasquatch, we riot</p><p>o yeah and robt emenegger - the (highly suspect) writer/composer of PSI FACTOR********* shows up &amp; linda moulton howe wears a beret check it out!!! 👽👽👽 #ufo #alien #area51raid</p><p>*<a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/ufotv/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/list/ufotv/</a></p><p>**"In the late 1950s, it seems, the U.S. Air Force really was working on Project 1794 to build a supersonic saucer.

JAG, and told me this was your fav episode of JAG &amp; made me watch it id prob enjoy it. you know they made talky reservoir dogs ripoffs in the 90s too, right? we didnt get all excited it was just regular movies, not some fanfare for the forgotten man of rural america or some shit. this is written exactly like somebody's first stageplay, and like BRAWL'n-CB99 its another great exploitation/thriller premise attached to a movie way too inert &amp; sloppy to pay it off, desperate to shore up its deficiency with lazy culture war signifiers. i LOVE seeing james badge dale &amp; chris mulkey in a 2019 release (too bad they wasted mel &amp; don cuz both couldve slid into this ensemble... no udo kier tho, its getting sad) but ive read more bo gritz rants than any sane person to know this doesnt really capture the whole thing its supposed to be about. funny how the kinda nerds who make movies like this still think militia extremists are all stoic john wayne/dirty harrys and not neurotic IT guys with a bunch of pepe/qanon/molon labe stickers on the f150 posting DEAL WITH IT memes of jess sessions in shades smoking a blunt. obv every movie about "MEN" from 70s scorsese to daddy's home 2 is made by nerds romanticizing their unattained masculinity, but this shit veers into those tv dinner ads like "THERE WAS A TIME WHEN FOOD COULD SATISFY A MAN'S CRAVING.......GO FORK YOURSELF!!!" or nu country radio with the ultra-pandering lyrics (drink a beer, bag a deer / love my country, church on sundays / hunt a buck, drive my truck) all stuffed into the shape &amp; form of a mediocre indie drama. i gotta admit its clever branding to make a24 movies for dudes who get off on (white) iraq vets yelling "MAN UP!!" but with uneventful art-house pacing &amp; lazy indy production. these dorks love to pretend their movies - unlike liberal hollyWEIRD - are ABOVE politics, simultaneously more artistic &amp; less academic, because writing in aryan nations as a "neutral" signifier is more "ambiguous" than l.a. snowflakes virtue-signaling nazism isnt ok (as if CRASH didnt win 35 oscars). hes conflicted, as a white nationalist... who also likes cops! wow! makes u think! and look im..... intrigued by paranoid anti-gov survivalist shit but they dont explore any of the ideological stuff (or racism) its just hard-ass window dressing, like 80s cannon movies who made their hero a rhodesian merc to prove he can kill foreigners (they do this in MEGAFORCE). have you seen an interview with this dallas sonnier guy?? dude went to film school in CALIFORNIA, managed greta gerwig, got her in noah baumbach flix, now hes on fox news talking about "elites" n how nobody in real america's ever heard of timothee chalamet ("i'm just a simple, country movie producer..."). these posers run fangoria!! one of these days we're gonna wake up n find cinestate adapting the turner diaries playing dumb on some ol "its not like we're endorsing it, its just that nobody else would do it... its always going to be controversy, but there's a market for this stuff..."</p><p>ok &amp; im not a gun nut but if you had a bunch of guys in your lumberyard like 20 min after firing 500 rounds from ar15 (which, no joke, one of em calls an "automatic rifle") why would you do a bunch of gossiping &amp; pondering &amp; tarantino slow-burn interrogations instead of just smelling their hands/arms for gunpowder?? (2 of em said theyd been hunting, but still) at least they get right that these kinda groups are crawling with cops &amp; feds, right down to the [spoiler] weird twist ending - not subversion by infiltration, just a direct pipeline. i guess thats a win? </p><p>so i guess im mixed but this is still about 800 times better than any actual zahler shit ive seen and clocks in at exactly EIGHTY EIGHT MINUTES instead of 3-4 hours like all his seem to (puppet master was a slim 90 just cuz it literally has no ending) so i guess you can - and will - do a lot worse! ok bye</p>

<br><p>they finally did it... a24 has gentrified eli roth</p><p>kind of a mess and i rly dont trust this guy to take trauma/grief seriously but this is packed with great sick jokes and i love the cannibal ferox/2000 maniacs genre so ill turn up even for a slow, kinda pointless version of one. despite the hype i thought hereditary was p good too - this guy has built his rep on being solid at the drama stuff (directing actors) and really swinging for the fences with the horror/gore shit but has completely failed to synthesize them in any real way so its all just kinda thrown together into a collection of scenes that actually work, until they dont - i guess the accomplishment is making drama audiences watch gore &amp; gore audiences watch a drama?? in this &amp; hereditary all the real-life family tragedy shit is wielded like a kid who just discovered racial slurs, excited that hes "hacked" his way into getting a emotional reaction - its unsettling but sorta empty &amp; irresponsible (interviewed about his 1st short film he said his movie buddies were kicking around ideas of what would be the "ultimate taboo" and arrived at incest as the "most popular" one - very cool!). he also seems to only write characters who are totally passive &amp; conflict-averse, which i think is an art-house thing but def presents more of a barrier to general audience enjoyment than any rubber head explosions (which normal people have seen on like, BONES) even if criterion stans think its staggeringly transgressive. i watch a LOT of movies made by dudes who im sure spent most of 5th and 6th grade on rotten.com but he's the only one critics seem to take seriously - i guess docile middle-class hipsters who dont put up a fight find more to relate to than like, bill zebub. still its cool to get regal 24 blumhouse audiences out to see a movie that occasionally feels like something from matthew barney's cremaster cycle and the (eventually overdone) druggy reality warp fx reminded me of the schizo facemorphs in, no bullshit, terror toons. i know this is gonna get dinged as derivative but honestly throwing together a bunch of weird horror shit ripped off from better movies, italian-style, is one of my fav ways to make a movie, and the only tricks i outright hated were some a24(tm) symmetrical framing of, sigh, triangles (surprised the cult didnt have brass &amp; white marble succulent planters) and corny omg-what-if-you-had-to-see-an-old-person-naked??? shit (as seen in hereditary AND the IT:2 trailer that played before this) - you could easily cut 30-45min with no real loss but the long runtime does give it a sense of actually spending a week at a real, strange place, and i guess that counts for something. theres something funny going on here, where all the selfconsciously weird/shock shit seems insincere, smarmy &amp; tryhard but in the process dude is telling on himself &amp; making something actually kinda weird in a different &amp; unexpected way, which is how some of my fav movies are (unintentionally) great. its complicated. </p><p>also look out for one line that proves this dude def saw my hereditary review <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/film/hereditary/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/film/hereditary/</a></p>

<br><b>714: Rock With Barney</b>
<br><p>BARNEY BASHERS, you won't believe that latest slam against the purple prehistoric pest: </p><p>Someone saw the devil in a Barney video.</p><p>This hellish story was not stirred up by some wacko. Some sensible people took it seriously.</p><p>The story begins with a family in Maryland Heights. The couple wants to remain anonymous, said police chief Neil Kurlander. "They're afraid of a media circus."</p><p>Here's the story from the chief:</p><p>"The couple purchased a videotape, `Barney's Birthday,' in June 1993," he said. "Around that time, their 3-year-old started having nightmares.</p><p>"About three weeks later, the mother took a photo of her daughter sitting in front of the TV set." "Barney's Birthday" was playing on the TV.</p><p>The photo showed an angelic child. "It also showed an image on the TV screen. It appears to be a demon or devil with an upside-down cross on its forehead.</p><p>"It really does," the chief said. "I saw it.</p><p>"The parents were shocked and upset. There was enough for us to decide not to walk away."</p><p>A Maryland Heights detective took the "original negative of the mother's photograph to a professional processing lab. The lab said the negative did not appear to be tampered with."</p><p>The devil was so vivid, "we suspected someone had pirated film and inserted it," Chief Kurlander said.</p><p>"We contacted the FBI. The FBI said they would check out the video for possible added subliminal messages or copyright violations."</p><p>The video went to the Motion Picture Association of America for tests. "The MPAA found the film had not been tampered with, and there was no subliminal satanic message."</p><p>The devil appeared by some unholy accident.</p><p>"It turned out to be a coincidence. In the editing process, it's not unusual to overlap five to 10 frames during a fade. You can see through the frames for a double image. </p><p>The fact remains that the video contains a Satanic image, one which "cannot be seen during regular viewing," according to the chief. </p><p>Yet MPAA officials do not consider it to be a subliminal Satanic message, even though the MPAA itself found another "demonic" scene during the same tape. </p><p>"It showed Barney attacking a child," according to the chief, "But it's just a freak... whether the devil caused that freak accident is open to interpretation."</p><p>Barney PR spin doctor Beth Ryan says Barney has been cleared of any wrongdoing. She assures parents that "we take a lot of care and time to make things like this don't happen." </p><p>Which begs the question: Why do the creators of Barney tapes have to work so hard to keep Satanic messages out of their videos? </p><p>Perhaps these kinds of "accidents" have happened before.</p>

<br><p>far from perfect (overbearing score, cliched/quippy sitcom banter, too many tv &amp; movie refs, annoying british guy dropped in for no reason) but for VOD horror you can do way worse. plays out like the cabin-bound evil dead riff you expect, until it doesnt - the quantum dimensional shit falls somewhere between insidious's kinda-boring ghostlore and the spatial/geometric/topological eschatology of CRYPTIC PLASM but needs more eerie, subtle weirdness like the sun not setting or the runic symbol they put on the car and less stringy black-haired ringu girls and the voldemort/pale man dude from the poster (who also look like the Keyfingerer or whatever the fuck his name was from the last insidious) - its all well shot &amp; lit with interesting color grading but for something this committed to oddity its lacking a specific visual imagination when all the interdimensional creations have that 1997-2005 horror aesthetic without the makeup budget of like, THIR13EN GHOSTS. drags in the middle when it turns into a possession movie where everybody yells at each other but the performances are solid, especially hattie smith, taylor flowers &amp; spooky new zealander william kircher giving heavy baldwin/wayne newton vibes (i thought it was an unbilled daniel or stephen for real) and when they introduce an all new totally baffling mythology in the 3rd act it gets weird/good again. also the writer/director's dad is former arizona attorney general grant woods a republican-turned-dem who was john mccain's chief of staff &amp; known as "arizona's most famous RINO" lmao</p>

<br><p>this 1967 (!) movie (feels 62/kennedy era but NO this came out the same year as bonnie + clyde &amp; corman's the trip, right before 2001) is based around a visibly-43 yr old don knotts playing a 30something virgin space-nut ("i'm 35 years old!") living at home with his barely-older mom (jeanette nolan, who i guess had him at 12) and jingoistic, flag-humping ww1 vet dad who demands his loser son do him proud by - at the height of the vietnam war - joining "the service", meaning he secretly signs him up for (shades of the draft) the "federal space agency" (or fsa, not the syria one) but, in a shocking SPOILER reveal, admits he faked his own military service &amp; spent the great war as a LIBRARIAN! disgracefully explaining his war wound was caused by a falling encyclopedia britannica - "B to D"</p><p>i was shocked to see, in the year of pentagon protests &amp; napalmed villages, the stolen valor of a militaristic patriot vet played as a goof in a "shook-up shopping cart" don knotts flick for idiots- stuff like this, along with barely any jokes or gags or slapstick, means the first 2/3rds of this plays out more like an indie drama than a comedy, as knotts attempts to hide from his abusive war hero dad &amp; conservative missouri hometown the shameful truth that he's a melvin junko mop boy not a heroic moonwalker. its really weird! </p><p>when we open he's working a ride at a colorful space-themed kiddy park with lowkey herschell gordon lewis vibes in universal studios' beautiful "courtyard square" backlot (GREMLINS' kingston falls) and takes a leisurely 85 minutes to get anywhere close to outerspace where we FINALLY get some visible-wire zero g fx with spacemoog score (the rest of the movie is just irritating variations on "do you know the muffin man") and hilariously wack use of grainy/damaged stock footage (including that one SATURN I takeoff clip youve seen in everything) with a fake moon landing set that looks about as good as the "real" one</p><p>ok and this premiered in houston two DAYS before the apollo 1 fire that killed gus grissom! a movie about a fuckup astronaut who at one point even has to fight a fire in his weirdly-bigger-on-the-inside space capsule! what the fuck! </p><p>they come up with the scheme to send assistant janitor knotts to space at the last minute to beat the soviets who plan to send up a DENTIST and not-nasa acts like this is a huge thing even tho im pretty sure most of the o.g. cosmonauts were like factory workers and shit not hotshot topgun pilots (regular civilian valentina tereshkova did it in 1963 - 4 yrs before this, 20 yrs before sally ride). the idea of sending a normal guy into space for propaganda purposes was used/ripped off by "deep space homer" which also stole the chips/crackers floating around in zero g ("careful, they're ruffled!") from this</p><p>anyway its no <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cat-from-outer-space/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/film/the-cat-from-outer-space/</a> but its worth a watch just to see how movies in the late 60s werent actually cool</p>

<br><b>734: Santa Fe</b>
<br><p>this is one of those quirky 90s dramadies nobody remembers but contains some alchemical jungian synchro-destiny predicting the 2020 democratic primary where not only does lolita davidovich play a new age self-help guru based on our next president marianne williamson but the mayor of santa fe is a pandering white liberal named "robert" whose campaign appeals to hispanics by having him go by "beto"!! ok i dont believe the predictive programming guys who think 9/11 was foretold by cosby in ghost dad or whatever but seeing border-state voters holding signs chanting BETO! for a cynically-named white candidate, back when the real o'rourke was playing bass for the verve pipe or whatever is a trip &amp; im gonna make a weird 3 hr youtube about it </p><p>anyway i kinda liked this shit! the box art makes it look like a thriller but its actually a character-based romantic comedy set in the aftermath of a mass suicide/waco standoff (shot before but released after heavens gate, speaking of predictive programs). director andrew shea (THE CORNDOG MAN) has zero idea what message or tone he wants but all the healing crystals &amp; pink-pastel cool ranch southwest adobe vibe almost makes up for stuff like gary cole's daughter being one of those precocious indie movie kids who sets her dad up on dates. theres some interesting ideas about cult psychology &amp; i usually like movies where the main character is mentally ill without being all wacky about it (gary cole's recovering cult-member cop has a touch of - no bullshit - will graham in manhunter) but its also lowkey racist with an unfortunate jeffrey jones cameo that has him interacting with a child. the most riveting scene is when visiting officer gary cole explains to a 5th grade classroom his former cult addiction &amp; intense need for belonging while he projects onto the chalkboard slides of jfk, mao, gandhi, marx, lennon, manson, david koresh, jesus christ, and......... lolita davidovich! not good, but recommended</p>

<br><p>fanon is someone ive never read (sorry) but gets quoted/ref'd by everybody i love (first heard of him in the mau maus song from bamboozled, lol) and while i found this doc kinda light on info its surprisingly artful and romantic in a way that reminded me of schrader's mishima. theres a lot of stuff about his personal relationships (especially hypocrisy around interracial/gay ones, kinda dwelled on) and his role in algerian liberation (which idk enough about) but i wanted more on his philosophies of racial identity, influence on modern liberation movements (dont think the BPP gets mentioned even once) and his death in cia custody. still, this is good. </p><p>(watched for memorial day)</p>


<br><b>738: Brightburn</b>
<br><p>more than any other subgenre i go back n' forth on actually liking evil/creepy kid movies and i guess this confirms i like em well enough to watch a boring, competent, tv pilot-y attempt at one but, listen: this has the same runtime as SLITHER and maybe 1/100th as much stuff happens. throw on a half-star for some gore gags, sweetwater 420 signs, one of those slasher classroom scenes where they explain the metaphor (in this case, wasps who trick other bugs into raising their larvae) &amp; 15 intoxicating, delirious seconds of michael rooker as alex jones</p>
<br><b>739: The Perfection</b>
<br><p>lol i cant stand netflixx but knew this was a banger when the first 20 seconds threw out like 3-4 (SPOILERS! DONT READ TIL U WATCH!) dumb, show-off-y split diopter shots straight outta raising cain &amp; the title card slowly turns the E in PERFECTION backwards like the ron paul REVOLUTION logo (or eminem's, lol) and i realized this was gonna be that nutso, proudly UN-elevated horror shit i live for. spent the first uncomfortable 3rd of this - which is GREAT sicko shit - wondering what the fuck problem allison williams has with black/white relationships (shes gaslighting her way thru yet another one &amp; i wanted the other girl to be like IT WAS THAT CHICK FROM GET OUT!!! like a gag in scary movie 4) but every time i thought i knew what was going on, 80 more stupid twists would have me straight flabbergasted (ok twists #3 or #4 it was like, this is too many twists! you cant flip it every 30 seconds!!! but the final 3rd reveals a strong theme &amp; sincerity that somehow all clicked for me, from the miramax logo to that preposterous final shot). an aged, grandiose steven weber in circle-frame glasses gazing beatifically at flawless cello performances before an amputation-comeuppance rips off his arms &amp; legs like (jeff combs voice) a gingerbread man is exactly the intersection of trashy &amp; classy that makes a great b-thriller, especially when the highbrow classical score keeps turning up licks from star trek 6: the undiscovered country. i would give anything for erotic thrillvenge shit this confidently bugfuck to drop into 3600 theaters instead of "escape room: origins" but i guess its more important every non-disney release gets dumped on netflix holiday weekends so everyone can half-watch it riding home from a bbq in a lyft or whatever. anyway this is great exploitation and trapaholics real trash shit so if you didnt listen &amp; are reading this anyway uh check it out</p>


<br><b>740: The Baron</b>
<br><p>for some shit i never heard of this was sharper &amp; more interesting than expected, a kinda meta-blaxplo about self-funded blaxploitation director/star THE BARON (calvin lockhart, predator 2's KING WILLIE) playing a goofy, snoopyesque film-within-a-film character beloved by kids, who multiple slimebags suggest he recast as white for increased box office (v. interesting coming from phil fenty, writer of SUPERFLY). theres real intelligence &amp; wit in this, a cynicism mixed with.. i dunno, joyousness? the savvy optimism you get from the best of 70s black cinema, standard movie crime scenes broken up by ones struck with tension &amp; meaning. i normally hate post-godfather b-movies that do the italian mafia thing (unless its bronson's THE FAMILY, shot pre-godfather) but this has richard lynch slithering around as a perverse, racist mob guy and every scene hes in really sets ON FIRE (sorry). the whole thing is shot with a hazy sun-dappled 70s greyish-green album cover look (at least on my st clair entertainment dvd "FRED WILLIAMSON IN BLACK ACTION CINEMA: OVER 13 HOURS!") and theres a (spoilers) revenge ending almost as satisfying as the last 5 minutes of superfly. oh yeah and the score? gil scott heron. recommended!</p>


<br><b>741: Stomp Shout Scream</b>
<br><p>cute lil monster beach party throwback that never really takes off into anything interesting (like most actual monster beach party movies). i admire being so generically even-tempered without veering into kitsch mockery or wacky/cruel troma farce but as far as early 2000s AIP throwbacks go it doesnt nail the b-movie vibe like the lost skeleton of cadavra guy, plus the skunk ape they keep promising never really shows up and when it finally does looks 100x worse than like, THE GHOST IN THE INVISIBLE BIKINI. the music is killer (ill overlook a lot of flaws if your main characters are a 60s all-girl garage rock band) and the whole thing has a blandly pleasant zeal &amp; gusto that i kept rooting for them to distill some of the lunatic energy of EEGAH or HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND and they never did!</p>

<br><p>a kid with a mr bill in space poster and an uncle who looks like larry fessenden meets a lil verne troyer dude in a lumpy green skinsuit with a (dubbed???) deep ass voice who steals bananas and speaks an alien language that sounds like "king pong king kong king pong poo." i loved watching this lil nerd waddlin round slidin his tiny ass down the rocket stairs! he gets to celebrate holi (the color festival), mistakes a buddhist temple for a spaceship, and, in an uncomfortable scene, licks the young boy back to health with his tiny tongue. this is one of those otherwise serious 80s asian movies that has to have a stupid fat guy with a bowlcut who gets scared of everything and falls down and stuff but i liked everything else including a cameo from a real life indian spacewalker who was on soyuz and has a bunch of soviet medals. also theres a bollywood melodica version of "happy birthday to you" and the kid has a cool pet doberman who hangs out with the alien and does tricks. india absolutely loves making ET ripoffs and i will never stop watching them!</p><p>(btw babula is the name of the kid NOT the alien)</p>

<br><b>753: John Wick Chapter 3 Parabellum</b>
<br><p>ehhhh.... not BAD but def feels like 3rd in a franchise. of course we get wild ass incredible brawls/action/choreography (shot on a mostly still camera!) but the mythology is so overwhelming and corny and feels like shit a guy from my high school would make up - lots of epic art-of-war gentlemen in designer suits walking up to hotel counters saying shit like "quite the amuse-bouche indeed..." (i was expecting one of em to solemnly intone "swag is for boys, class is for men"). none of the rapturous ass-kisser critics will admit this but its essentially boondock saints with better fight scenes. i loved wick 1, didnt see pt2 (was actively opposed to it) but for real if this wasnt a pt3 youd have zero reason to care about this guy or anyone else in it - dude has like 50 lines and half of em are going "yeah" when somebody asks if hes ok. every time they cut from an insane 10-guy hong kong melee to some ed hardy tatted rockabilly pompadour secretary in a brass steampunk office announcing "the elite council declares john wick ex-communicado" (who are they talking to??) i wanted to groan out loud &amp; throw my drink at the screen. i got a real 90s tv pilot/hellraiser dtv sequel vibe off this stuff, especially with a character named "The Adjudicator of The High Table" (lol) played by a nonbinary actor working their bebe-neuwirth-as-lilith-on-cheers vibe. the whole concept of having this secret, esoteric market-driven bureaucracy of opulence &amp; privilege &amp; respect is so empowering to loser gamestop guys who cant make it in the real world but like to imagine theyd be world-class feared &amp; respected contract killers sipping whiskey &amp; trading magic coins for antique pistols - there's a real sovereign citizen mentality to the whole thing thats 100% not my thing ("i just wanted someone to call me "sir" without adding "you're making a scene")</p><p>i'll admit when this started i had no idea what was going on or even who was in the last one - we just jump in, no buildup, to an essentially dialogue-free first act, coasting off the cool factor of chinese neon signs in the rain (cabbies let dude bring a wet dog in a cab??) with nyc extras huddled in slick black coats (breaking rule #1 of action movie extras theres no dorky american tourist in a "who farted??" tee to do a doubletake at all the brazen public knifings) then gets a lil more interesting as johnny wick takes an orientalist trip to morocco, where kinda racistly almost all the goons are asians n arabs (i know keanu is asian) but at least we get john wick stumbling around a cool-looking koyaanisqatsi desert. here in weird naked lunch soundstage morocco he connect with a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/unawarewolf/list/top-10-psychotronic-halle-berry-ranked/" rel="nofollow">PSYCHOTRONIC</a> halle berry who is doing some of the only actual character stuff here just thru sheer force of will &amp; personality. i loved her in this!! especially when she let her dogs - perpetual martyrs of this series - get their revenge with a dick-biting, wall-climbing murder rampage (it really nails what a dumb-guy normie franchise this is that the basis of the whole series is being into cute puppies &amp; dogs....in pt 4 theyre gonna establish that john wick also watches the office on netflix and DO NOT even talk to him until hes had his coffee!!) </p><p>all the other fanfic callbacks ("he shot my dog." "i get it.") and lil meta joke refs to sergio leone &amp; the matrix were lame EXCEPT for what in pretty sure is a tribute to keanu's horny musical chairs routine in KNOCK KNOCK where he keeps awkwardly moving away from iron chef guy on a leather couch - the iron chef (coming off a mortal kombat webseries....thats the level we're at here) as #1 john wick fanboy and a chuckling, ghost-dogging larry fishburne (who, like everybody i wanted more of, has about 3 lines, one of which is "sometimes you gotta cut a motherfucker") are the only ones having any fun with this laughable wannabe-badass kingsmen shit. i was hootin n whoopin early on when the 7ft guy gets his noggin library booked but by the time the movie limps to a fistfight in the big dorky glass apple store/resident evil office with huge pulsating winamp visualizations (does the head of the assassin org just chill &amp; do biz in there??) i was mostly as bored &amp; tired as keanu looked. im not one of those action nerds who gets hyped off every stuntman with 3 seconds of screentime that i recognize from some 1992 hong kong movie (at least one of em gets a dope fulci eyestab) but i can appreciate how dudes like that prob really love this - its 130 minutes of dumb nonsense and the 1st hour (besides the fights) is just total death onscreen but parts of it almost reminded me of corny horror shit i love like LORDS OF SALEM where u know rob zombie is lame as shit but just gotta roll with the art-directed luxury fetish dumb guy vibe (they both do classical music in a big old gilded theatre) and i gotta say i respect the hell out of em for still doing those goofy stylized subtitles l.f.h. mentioned in her review <a href="https://letterboxd.com/theblogosfear/film/john-wick/1/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/theblogosfear/film/john-wick/1/</a> so add a star or 2 if youre a guy who has ever bought replica katanas at a gun show or put a KEEP CALM AND CHIVE ON sticker on your 2009 nissan cube </p><p>also this movie doesnt have an ending! (its a cliffhanger for a sequel ill prob skip) &amp; i cant stand this new endless-scroll tv serialization every movie goes for nowadays - john wick (2014) was a complete story! he gets redeemed! you dont need 80 more episodes of these!! oh yeah and im not a cgi hater but digital blood fuckin sucks</p><p>btw in the trailer for CRAWL (which im def seeing) why is sam raimi called "a producer" of the evil dead but aja's listed as "THE director" of the hills have eyes ???? sound off in the john wick review comments</p>


<br><b>754: Missing In Action</b>
<br><p>"disinformation, in order to be effective, must be 90% accurate" - Chuck Norris, WorldNetDaily.com</p><p>growing up as a kid with a nam vet dad i heard a lot of POW/MIA stuff from a lot of fucked up guys with YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN stickers on their work trucks (i still cant see one without thinking of my friend who told me she thought POW/MIA meant POWER to the MAFIA). the whole idea of our boys forgotten, disowned by their country &amp; decaying in jungle torture dungeons had so much power for this generation of vets &amp; their families it was unthinkable to question it. the POW story was so entrenched in 90s politics &amp; culture that by the time i was old enough to understand it was hard to see where it came from, or if it was even true or not: perot ran his 92 spoiler campaign on bringing POWs home,* bent on unseating the president who'd told him there were no survivors. he even picked a "hanoi hilton" vet as his VP. that b&amp;w POW-MIA flag, created by an ad agency at request of a flag retailer, became the only non-u.s. flag to fly over the white house, which it still does, six times a year. going to the video store seemed like every tape on the action shelf was a cocky nam rescue mission like this one. there were MIA xmas ornaments, congressional hearings, floats in halloween parades and hand-stitched biker jacket patches. nobody really talks about this stuff now cuz most vietnam vets are old and dead, but when i was young, it was everywhere. </p><p>1. 1973</p><p>after the '73 paris peace accords, all 591 american POWs were returned in "operation homecoming." over half the POWs (325 of em) were bomber pilots shot down over north vietnam, like hollywood's fav warmonger john mccain, and nearly every soldier listed "MIA" (instead of KIA for killed in action) was a casualty from secretly attacking cambodia and laos, where admission of u.s. deaths wouldve been an international crime. nixon used the concept of secret POWs to stall peace talks &amp; prolong the war, but after the withdrawal even he was forced to admit there were no remaining prisoners. the whole POW/MIA cause, the whole idea of POWs held secretly in vietnam, was a lie - there's zero evidence any american soldier or journalist was kept there after the end of the war. "its a mark of national insanity," said historian h.bruce franklin, "perot and nixon sat down in their office and manufactured the entire issue."* even the name of the movement - POW-slash-MIA - was designed to boost the numbers by conflating two uneven, unrelated groups. </p><p>i dont know if my dad literally believed this stuff, but there was real cathartic solidarity to supporting this movement. even without proof, the POW-MIA cause felt emotionally true: it took all your anger &amp; distrust towards the government who sent you off to kill &amp; die and transferred it to hating the vietnamese as spiteful wardens motivated not by anti-imperialist self-defense but pure, sadistic evil. this settler-colonialist "captivity narrative" (like stories of american indians snatching up white pioneer women) transubstantiated the 2 opposing factions - guerilla underdogs became conquering tyrants, while yankee trespassers are reduced to feeble slaves dreaming of freedom 9000 miles from home. the helplessness that americans felt about waging global violence in their names (&amp; not even winning!) was poured into the absolving soul of our "helpless" POWs acquitted as victims, not victimizers. unlike past wars, losing nam meant the u.s. had no (official) access to the country it invaded, and the further we got from the 73 withdrawal the stronger - more vivid &amp; hysterical - the idea would become. here's GOP congressman (+ vanderbilt family cousin!) john leboutillier in the 1984 new york times:</p><blockquote><p>"Hundreds of recent refugee reports, verified with ''lie-detector'' machines, describe similar scenes: American pilots are held as slaves in caves and remote villages, guarded by Vietnamese and Laotian soldiers, forced to repair American weapons and electronic equipment left over from the war."</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/20/opinion/rotting-in-laos.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/1984/08/20/opinion/rotting-in-laos.html</a></p></blockquote><p>(in 86 leboutillier was busted for illegally arming laotian mercenaries to reinvade nam but the reagan justice dept overruled the ATF charges stating his activities were "supported by the US government".*)</p><p>so i get the "why" of this, why vets (and americans) wanted to believe it, the need to explain, to excuse, to understand. my dad came back disabled &amp; threw away all his medals. by the 80s he was protesting reagan with groups like veterans for peace, but still held onto some of the reactionary stabbed-in-the-back elements of the MIA-POW myth. i believe there was a real controlled effort to misdirect vets' rightful anger, to divert criticism of the govt's role in the war &amp; their own accountability. after vietnam, people had a lot of questions, but like pynchon said, if they get you asking the wrong questions, they dont have to worry about the answers. howd they change the question?</p><p>2. HOLLYWOOD</p><p>just as the "lost cause" of the noble, defeated confederacy was sold by GONE WITH THE WIND and BIRTH OF A NATION, the push to romanticize the POW-MIA lost cause was made at the movies. the MIA myth found its biggest validation in two of the biggest hits of 1984: FIRST BLOOD PART II and MISSING IN ACTION. honestly i think stallone meant well, at least for the first movie, but humbled, broken-down john rambo endorsing the POW lie meant disillusioned hippie vets finally could see themselves in the sensitive, long-haired half-navajo green beret who knows the war was "wrong" but has to refight it to win (rambo sez "im not right wing, im not left wing" but stands up for "ordinary americans"). my dad, who loved action movies but had intense/severe combat shock, couldnt stand to watch it (we watched predator instead). like most movies about the military, changes were forced once the cameras were rolling, and james cameron ended up disowning his own script protesting his criticism of u.s. foreign policy was "edited out," eventually declaring he wrote the "action" &amp; stallone handled the "politics."</p><p>people called chuck norris's less subtle, superficially similar MISSING IN ACTION a "rambo ripoff" or, if they know a lil better, claimed stallone ripped off chuck, since MIA came out a good 6 months before the first blood sequel (which already felt like hollywood's stab at an elevated/cleaned up cannon flick) but here's the thing: with POW-MIA propaganda, norris got there first, way first, not 6 months, but six YEARS earlier, in his first-ever leading role: 1978's <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/good-guys-wear-black/" rel="nofollow">GOOD GUYS WEAR BLACK</a>. </p><p>good guys wear black is hollywood's foundational "POW-MIA" movie: chuck plays a vet of the CIA's infamous vietnam psyop/torture phoenix program who leads a team back to nam to rescue POWs left behind, only to find a larger, more confusing situation unfold. the writer, a personal friend of norris &amp; part of the apollo 8 crew (!!), crafts his rescue mission around a trendy 70s watergate conspiracy plot (including a recreation of the plane crash that killed e.howard hunt's wife***) but the movie's then-unheard-of scenario of vets refighting nam to get back POWs would, without the twist, become inescapable action cliche just a few years later. how did this revisionist bullshit flourish to the point we get competing stallone &amp; norris blockbusters about it the same year?? where'd they get the idea for this? america's 2 fav celebrity commie-killers weren't imitating each other, they were looking to a real, living guy:</p><p>3. BO GRITZ</p><p>james gordon "bo" gritz (pron. RIGHTS, like his nutso campaign manifesto "the bill of gritz") is a retired green beret special forces major who used u.s. military support to run illegal post-war "rescue missions" in southeast asia to grab what he claimed were thousands of imprisoned soldiers, securing himself speaking arrangements &amp; magazine covers but, predictably, no rescued POWs. before hollywood started making movies about gritz, they were making the myth of gritz - the missions' actual resources may have come from the army's then-secret ISA ("intelligence support activity") org but the public face of support was donations from actors like william shatner and clint eastwood. </p><p>you can read the "official" story on this guy all over the place - 3rd-party presidential run (like perot), phoenix program CIA torturer (like chuck in "good guys"), former delta force (like chuck in… delta force), self-proclaimed "real-life rambo" and inspiration for apocalypse now &amp; the a-team &amp; all that shit. he seems to pop up everywhere, a real "forrest gump" (major red flag if youve followed my unhinged rantings since HANKS=CIA) but whats most interesting to me about this is how many actual rightwing vets + militia troopers consider their self-annointed spokesman a "kook-wrangler" secretly bamboozling the radical right into backing washington's whims &amp; spreading disinfo on everything from jfk &amp; ufos to satanic ritual abuse. fellow NWO-foe don bradley said he asked gritz in 2006 at a conspiracy convention why he was spying for the CIA - gritz replied "I tried to go straight, ten years ago, but they were just too rough on me."******</p><p>just like reagan's 1980 win (the ultimate synthesis of hollywood anti-communism), the early 80s militia movement - t"new patriotism" - grew out of the right's twin defeats in civil rights &amp; vietnam, an overcompensation designed to make america great again with the same "correction" of loser status that fueled the POW-MIA myth ("do we get to win this time?"). gritz &amp; rambo &amp; reagan (who loved reinforcing this shit - after all, he was held captive in asia himself, in the 1954 film PRISONER OF WAR) all represented different entry points for the same big scheme. this movement insisted they were on the fringes, but how subversive can you be when the president &amp; military support you? "bo" turns up again &amp; again in this kinda mainstream good cop/bad cop role, calling out outlandish conspiracies then corralling sympathetic believers into dead ends or useful idiocy - standard routine for feds trying to launder info or keep their hands clean of institutional bias (see: trump - both claim andrew jackson as their model). </p><p>side note for my ephron/nichols=CIA junkies: "right wing zealot" gritz has a buncha connects to the liberal karen silkwood cause, whether asking silkwood family lawyer gerry spence to represent randy weaver after ruby ridge or repeatedly teaming with left-wing activist &amp; lead attorney daniel sheehan thru his antiwar "christic institute"* for books, protests &amp; speaking arrangements. its hard not to think of manson=fed when you see bleeding-heart berkeley hippie yoga types embracing a pentagon-backed reaganite war criminal from the "christian patriot alliance", a guy who started his own creepy utopian cult compound ("almost heaven") and says shit like "Do you see the sign, the scent, stain and mark of the beast on America today? Are you willing to submit and join this seedline of Satan? Where you find perversion of God's laws you will find the worshippers of Baal with their roots still in Babylonian mysticism." - makes u think, right? </p><p>a genuine weirdo like stallone (who i love!) was almost complex &amp; kooky enough to play something close to the "real" gritz, but as a legendary kickass commie-slayer he'd find incarnation in another man:</p><p>4.CHUCK NORRIS</p><p>1968: freshly discharged from korea &amp; working for defense contractor northrop aviation*** (now stealth bomber producer/avengers partner northrop-grumman), carlos "chuck" norris began his film career handling stunts on john wayne's pro-war blockbuster THE GREEN BERETS, an expensive piece of pro-war propaganda shot at fort benning, georgia** with full assistance from the pentagon &amp; president johnson. wayne spent 3 weeks on an overseas defense dept tour doing "research" for the film and publically boasted it would eliminate all opposition to america's war. i havent seen it, but glamour's michael korda called it a "simple-minded tract in praise of killing, brutality and american superiority over asians," concluding "i do not know how it would be possible to produce a more revolting picture, short of giving martin bormann several million dollars for a technicolor movie showing auschwitz was a wonderful place to live". </p><p>the only film about the war to actually be released during the war, it was one of the biggest blockbusters of 1968 &amp; one of WBs biggest earners of the 1960s. adapted from a book by green beret robin moore (more on him in a few!), the plot involves a war-skeptical journalist who flies overseas to discover americans performing gentle humanitarian work while the soviet-backed viet cong commit bloody atrocities and, realizing the error of his ways, reverses his opposition to the war. at the same time this blatant propaganda was playing out onscreen, actual green berets in vietnam were murdering on CIA orders**** and disguising themselves as viet cong to carry out false flag psyop attacks (take it away, william blum's KILLING HOPE:</p><blockquote><p>"Senator Stephen Young of Ohio reported that while he was in Vietnam he was told by the CIA that the Agency disguised people as Vietcong to commit atrocities, including murder and rape, so as to discredit the Communists. After the report caused a flurry in Washington, Young said that he had been misquoted, that the CIA was not the source of the story. Congressman Cornelius Gallagher, who had accompanied Young on the trip, suggested that it "may well be that he [Young] spoke to a Vietcong disguised as a CIA man"." (?????) [Los Angeles Times, April 14, 1994 (pg 4)] - (pic: <a href="https://i.ibb.co/NjZw3xs/cia.jpg" rel="nofollow">i.ibb.co/NjZw3xs/cia.jpg</a> )</p></blockquote><p>these "false flags" weren't limited to the actors onscreen &amp; CIA overseas: wayne &amp; others promoting the film spread rumors that left-wing groups planned armed demonstrations &amp; bomb threats at premieres, further discrediting the idea of peaceful opposition to the war - none of this shit actually occurred, but it shows how the propaganda value beats profit motive when a studio is willing to let their star go around saying that people who see their movie will be violently attacked. for good measure, wayne also called the vietnamese "raping, torturing gorillas" and would refer to my lai as a "so-called massacre".</p><p>so this shit THE GREEN BERETS is what took chuck norris from a guy who'd just opened a little dojo in torrance CA - home of robinson helicopters, spun off from [donald sutherland in jfk voice] *bell helicopters* - to hollywood in 1968, the costliest &amp; deadliest year of the vietnam war. later that year after tasting fame behind the scenes, chuck would make his onscreen acting debut in THE WRECKING CREW, an oddball dean martin/sharon tate cold war/CIA assassin spy-spoof tied to all kinda late 60s cultural weirdness and, notably, his first collabo with his future WAY OF THE DRAGON costar:</p><p>4A: BRUCE LEE</p><p>credited as "karate advisor" on the film, bruce in 1968 was at the center of co-star tate &amp; her husband polanski's creepy LA party scene along with her ex-bf/fellow manson victim jay sebring. sebring was one of bruce's initial friends &amp; contacts in hollywood, the guy who got him hired as kato on the green hornet, but polanski suspected lee of tate &amp; sebring's home invasion murders** (murders that the feds - well, INS - said were retaliation for info she had about sirhan sirhan)******** claiming he found lee's glasses at the scene of the crime. in his autobio, bruce relates his discomfort at polanski's hollywood parties, which he described as "guys in their 50s making passes at 14 &amp; 15 year old girls." ("morals do not exist there" he said). (gritz met his wife when she enrolled in his karate class, aged 16). polanski's satanic panic psyop rosemarys baby, produced by kissinger buddy robert evans, debuted 2 weeks before the green berets - the same week as rfk's assassination, an assassination that split the antiwar primary vote and guaranteed the election of nixon &amp; escalation of the war. during this peak of american jingoism, bruce had become the archetype of an asian-american hero that whites admired &amp; even idolized, and for nixon &amp; the supporters &amp; architects of the war, demonizing america's south-asian enemy as "other" was a lot harder when enlistment-aged boys had posters of bruce lee on the wall. with bruce dead at 32 by 1973, chuck norris was free to take his rival's place as hollywood's #1 martial artist of the 70s, one who didn't question white male dominance or u.s. policy. the heroic asian role model bruce had created was replaced with sneaky, faceless orientals chuck norris would slaughter by the thousands. </p><p>1968 was a pivotal year for chuck, with the green berets and the wrecking crew setting into motion his twin futures as 70s kung fu badass and 80s right-wing nam commando. tangling with bruce lee &amp; mass-murdering commie yellow peril are 2 of the things that fed into the embarrassing bush-era meme of:</p><p>4B: CHUCK NORRIS FACTS</p><p>which like most modern "internet humor" seems born from some untraceable, unfunny collective consciousness but really its just 4chan + somethingawful. the idea of chuck as the world's biggest badass was a targeted nerdwashing of the badass black boasts of vietnam draft resister muhammad ali ("I'm so fast last night I turned off the light switch in my hotel room and was in bed before the room was dark.") applied to a guy involved in the single biggest propaganda effort of the war. the "free web" ecosytem has always been infested with feds - you can draw a straight line from heavily-compromised tor/EFF/lulzsec/anon crap to early-00s FBI honeypot encyclopedia dramatica (founded by an NSA "q" clearance cybersecurity expert <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherroddegrippo" rel="nofollow">www.linkedin.com/in/sherroddegrippo</a> ) and somethingawful's intel-contract "white hat" hackers, bored mercs jetting off to libya to try &amp; kill gaddafi (one of the CIA consultants dead in benghazi's embassy was SA moderator "vilerat"), and troll king/[alleged]FBI informant/swastika-tatted anti-semite weev (from paperclip to "irony guys" it always comes back to nazis x feds). ubisoft/gameloft (the guys who made like 800 tom clancy shooters called shit like RAINBOW SPEAR: GUANTANAMO BLACK OPS RECON STRIKE with pentagon/defense dept backing) even did a mobile game called CHUCK NORRIS: BRING ON THE PAIN (chris rock or method man???) where you kill fidel &amp; reinvade cambodia to - get this - rescue hidden american POWs. </p><p>im sure the CIA who funded abstract expressionism &amp; experimental poetry journals knew what an asset itd be to nudge libertarian gamer dorks on caturday anime boards into reactionary alpha-male nationalism and - eventually - coordinated fbook psyops, candidate email hacks and suicidal mass shootings. the 2016 /pol/meme-to-campaign pipeline that had trump posting rare pepes took an early test run with mike huckabee's awful, unwatchable 2008 campaign ads where he sat uncomfortably next to chuck reciting epic, forum-mined "chuck norris facts" </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDUQW8LUMs8" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDUQW8LUMs8</a></p><p>by the time of this atrocity, chuck had been acting onscreen forty years, a long way from his early kick/punch roles as sadistic villains &amp; forgettable thugs. he'd taken the spot as unlikely american hero to web-savvy YTMND nerds who knew a fist-pumped, flag-draped "america, fuck yeah!" might be a lil corny &amp; old-fashioned, yeah, but didnt that just make it cooler and funnier to say? looking back at chuck's metamorphosis from sheepish dojo master to walker: communist genocider, you can trace it all back to 1984, to the one film that definitively stripped from him every trace of 70s nuance &amp; vulnerability. it took MISSING IN ACTION to make norris a star, but that took a director who knew how to glorify a blank, emotionless killer:</p><p>5. JOSEPH ZITO (THE PROWLER, FRIDAY THE 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER)</p><p>before he became cannon film's go-to chuck vs commies guy (helming MISSING IN ACTION and the atlanta-shot INVASION USA, where chuck plays literal CIA) joseph zito directed his first film <a href="https://letterboxd.com/film/abduction-1975/" rel="nofollow">ABDUCTION</a> a fictionalized cash-in of the patty hearst kidnapping based on a novel written before it actually happened*******. BLACK ABDUCTOR, a 1972 novel where a multiracial group of leftwing militants kidnap the daughter (named "trish", short for "patricia") of a conservative billionaire, sees the heiress evolve from spoiled victim to radical true believer. the writer (a pseudonym) and publisher seem to still be a mystery but distribution for the novel came thru nova publishing, a subsidiary of hearst press - patty's family biz. zito's film was shot &amp; released while hearst was still running around robbing banks with the SLA (mostly CIA infiltrators &amp; police informants), but since it was based on a "fictional" story written 2 years before the kidnapping they were immune to any legal action. </p><p>in 1988, zito directed RED SCORPION (prod &amp; written by jack abramoff(!!!), reteaming with chuck's MIA buddy m. emmet walsh for a pro-apartheid dolph vehicle made with full south african military support. the film insisted that decolonization &amp; black majority rule were a secret soviet plot to be defeated by patriotic americans but the film itself was made as a front for abramoff's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Freedom_Foundation" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Freedom_Foundation</a> "ostensibly founded as a conservative think-tank, but in reality an elaborate South African military intelligence operation, code-named Operation Babushka. "*******</p><p>its no surprise that south african military intelligence saw the potential of zito &amp; his films to shape public opinion - after all, he'd sculpted the shy, soft-spoken chuck norris into such a potent icon of fascism that just last month cops mounted INVASION USA posters on their riot vans to terrorize protestors at G7 rallies ("the specific photo is from a poster of the movie Invasion U.S.A., in which Norris' character is pitted against communists from Cuba during the Cold War. Dupuis-Déri said he believes the police officers during the G7 saw themselves in Norris' role.")</p><p>zito signed onto the largely-forgotten RED SCORPION after wasting a year developing cannon's failed 80s spiderman movie (he wanted a pentagon-approved tom cruise), severing his profitable ties with golan &amp; globus's soon-to-implode company. the cold war was ending &amp; the studio was flailing, far from their glory days of the 70s &amp; early 80s. one of cannon's first hits had been 1975's THE HAPPY HOOKER, a globetrotting sex-work skin romp costarring INVASION USA's commie bad guy richard lynch, "coincidentally" written by the man responsible for the source book &amp; screenplay for THE GREEN BERETS - somebody i could write a book about myself:</p><p>5: ROBIN MOORE </p><p>white-nationalist mercenary &amp; [alleged] CIA asset robert lowell "robin" moore was born halloween night 1925 &amp; raised in ivy league theosophy alongside his hippie/new ager ketamine-mystic sister marcia (pron. MAR-SEE-AH), who mysteriously disappeared in 1978 (robin blamed witches???****). descended from the massachusetts lowells (one of boston's original "brahmin" families) their father, robert moore sr, founded sheraton hotels after developing top secret surveillance/military tech with learjet's william lear (coast to coast am listeners know his son john). later in (get this) 1968, he sold sheraton to former nazi weapons producer/future iran-contra conspirators ITT ("international telephone &amp; telegraph") who used their island resorts as a base to help the CIA organize pinochet's coup in chile. ok but, wait, so, back in 1949: after graduating harvard, lil robin moore sets out in the family business, maintaining a series of carribbean bar &amp; hotel properties that allowed for secret drug &amp; gun-running during cuba's revolution (inspiring his 1st book THE DEVIL TO PAY, where he "accidentally" details the rise of castro just like he "coincidentally" was in iran in 1977 right before the revolution - wow this guy's another "forrest gump"!) </p><p>robin moore based his 1966 international hit THE GREEN BERETS on his own experience of joining the special forces - his harvard classmate (roommate, he claimed to john wayne) robert f kennedy, then attorney general, had personally recommended him for the berets &amp; moore used this official referral &amp; his family status to rise quickly thru the ranks, becoming the public face of the unit, responsible for not just the book &amp; film but billboard's #1 single of 1966 (seriously, look it up!) "THE BALLAD OF THE GREEN BERETS" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5WJJVSE_BE" rel="nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5WJJVSE_BE</a></p><p>as a writer, moore always seemed to know what stories to tell: he published THE FRENCH CONNECTION in 1969, just in time to promote nixon's new international war on drugs &amp; "operation intercept", he drafted the script for (bush-connected) sun myung moon's revisionist korean war flick INCHON in 1980, and, like e.howard hunt, spent the manson/zodiac hangover of the early 70s crafting witchy satanic panic serial killer trash like DEATH DISCIPLE and THE HILLSIDE STRANGLER for the same shady cali pulp publishers behind that predictive hearst novel. like gritz, moore later edged into ufo disinfo with books on abductions &amp; area 51, and co-wrote what jfk scholars consider one of the absolute worst jfk assassination books, blaming everyone except the cia*******</p><p>despite his efforts with THE GREEN BERETS, america was leaving vietnam defeated &amp; war-weary, and by the mid-70s moore was left a military celebrity without a cause. after fighting commies overseas and refighting em in hollywood, he decided to use what he'd learned to sustain white colonial rule in apartheid rhodesia (now zimbabwe). zimbabweans had been fighting colonial euro occupiers since the 1800s, but by 1974 prime minister ian smith and his fascist "rhodesian front" party had started to see real signs of their own comeuppance. the green beret-founded SOLDIER OF FORTUNE mag began running mercenary recruitment ads targeted at nam vets, taking the green berets/red scorpion line that african liberation movements were all pawns of the communist USSR. moore came to then-capitol salisbury (now harare) at the request of william yarborough, leader of the "psychological warfare unit" of the u.s. army, and set up headquarters for an american-run militia he dubbed the "crippled eagles". none of this had official pentagon support, but the whole thing was official enough that white rhodesian soldiers boasted to european papers "the u.s. army" had showed up. the recruitment ads were even placed by "phoenix associates", named after the CIA's phoenix program in vietnam. </p><p>by 1975, the former nixon policy of supporting white-ruled african dictatorships (called, no bullshit, the TAR BABY OPTION <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_Baby_Option" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_Baby_Option</a> ) was slowing under prez ford but maintained wide support in the republican party. more even than south africa, rhodesia represented the closest thing the world had to a full-blown white nationalist state, the place where james earl ray tried to flee to after the MLK assassination. until reading up on this shit i had no idea what a big deal this was in 70s republican politics: gov reagan, running to ford's right in the 1976 primary, challenged the president's reluctance to send troops to rhodesia - ford's mild support for african majority rule was enough to secure reagan the bigot vote and win him at least one 1976 republican primary, even after ford ran ads that prophetically warned "when you vote tuesday, remember: governor reagan cant start a war. president reagan could." (ronnie voters considered that an endorsement). </p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/08/archives/reagan-attacks-ford-tv-tactics-challenger-is-disappointed-over.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/1976/06/08/archives/reagan-attacks-ford-tv-tactics-challenger-is-disappointed-over.html</a></p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/04/archives/rhodesia-remark-is-dogging-reagan-hes-repeatedly-being-asked-to.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/1976/06/04/archives/rhodesia-remark-is-dogging-reagan-hes-repeatedly-being-asked-to.html</a></p><p>along with all-american antiblack racism, moore's "counter-communist" crusade in africa was powered by that same desire to refight vietnam that animated gritz &amp; the gritz-inspired POW-MIA movies of stallone &amp; norris. daryl winkler, one of the highest ranking in this gang of CIA mongoose assassins &amp; MKULTRA test subjects************, said, quote, "90% of americans here are because they're unhappy with what happened with vietnam." after moore opened the mysteriously-funded unofficial embassy in salisbury, his old hollywood buddy john wayne even pledged to come by and support the cause - sadly, wayne's oxygen tank kept him from flying, but he assured robin he was "with him spiritually" gunning down black africans. of course, by 1980 rhodesia had ended up a lot like moore's vietnam, with u.s. spies, soldiers and mercs slinking home in defeat blaming jimmy carter for their "betrayal" (how can the govt "betray" a mission they didnt support?). but the tactics they'd had to make covert in rhodesia could now be deployed overtly at home: reagan's war on drugs recruited moore's green beret special forces vets to train urban police for domestic military SWAT activities in major cities nationwide. </p><p>in 2008, robin moore finally died at his home in hopkinsville, KY, the headquarters of the green berets 5th special forces unit (same as gritz &amp; rambo) and, for all my ufo-psyop/MILAB believers, the hopskinsville goblin encounter. he's buried in a family plot in concord massachusetts' sleepy hollow cemetery, alongside thoreau, ralph waldo emerson, louisa may alcott, and a bunch of the guys who built the h-bomb. </p><p>moore's cred as red-blooded patriot &amp; killer seems to contradict his pedigree of harvard pacifist thoreau philosophizing (mom &amp; dad founded the "thoreau lyceum" of concord in - you guessed it - 1968) and his karmic/new age reincarnation beliefs (unitarian, theosophist &amp; transcendentalist) but it really just completes the trifecta of 60s protest iconography co-opted &amp; reappropriated by clever warmongers, along with 2) the peaceful native american tribal vibe of campus war/eco protests assumed by norris &amp; stallone-as-rambo and 3) the left-conspiratorial/faux-countercultural "anti-imperialism" of fake isolationist bo gritz (not to mention blonde, blue-eyed chuck constructing his persona from stolen pieces of muhammed ali and bruce lee.)</p><p>chuck still gets plenty of wholesome mainstream publicity &amp; was last seen shilling the moronically-named fast food chain raising cane's (?) $100k check for his anti-drug "kickstart kids" nonprofit (co-founded with george h.w. bush, in case there werent enough CIA guys in this story) and a bizarre 5k charity race where thousands of people disguised as norris (???) ran a loop around the h.w. bush presidential library (!!!) to benefit chris field's 501c3 "mercy project" dedicated to, shades of robin moore, "disrupting africa." he just became the spokesman for glock handguns, and was with our shitty stupid asshole president at last month's 2019 NRA convention (where ollie north got overthrown) and in hungary practicing anti-immigrant "counter-terrorism" with fascist prime minister viktor orban.********************** </p><p>the official FBI and CIA story on these kinda civilian war games is always a bumbling failure to investigate or prosecute, whether its militia leader gritz re-invading southeast asia, moore's rhodesian soldier of fortune mercs massacring africans, or the rambo-loving "national front for the liberation of vietnam" murdering 5 anti-war vietnamese-american journalists in the 80s. in "rethinking the lumpen: gangsters and the political economy of capitalism" gerald horn talks about the usefulness of militias &amp; mercs to institutional global imperialism:</p><blockquote><p>"The promiscuous use of mercenaries was a close cousin to the deployment of pirates, buccaneers, and soldiers of fortune, whose bloodthirsty escapades often were the basis of the primitive accumulation of capital itself. One scholar has observed that the concept of “plausible deniability,” which has served imperialism so well in episodes ranging from Watergate to the Iran-Contra scandal, was actually invented by rulers in the early seventeenth century as a spur to mercenarism and piracy: thus, if these bandits obtained the necessary booty - fine - and if they did not or were apprehended, then responsibility for their activity could be denied"</p></blockquote><p>the ruling class will co-opt and infiltrate protest movements. nonconformists will serve their interests. the counterculture is not safe. big dumb 80s action schlock like this is obvious and can only be made useful now with the healing, protective redemption of irony, the same who-me? tactic used to hide the militarist core of liberal CIA projects today (see: the M***** C******** U*******). disinformation, in order to be effective, must be 90% accurate. they know exactly what they're doing. </p><p>ok but you get to see m. emmet walsh in an orgy so, 3 stars</p><p>(this review dedicated to the memory of mae brussell) </p><p>################################################<br/>FOOTNOTES I SHOULD PROB CLEAN UP SOMETIME</p><p>*<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/07/12/why-perot-was-right-about-americas-missing-soldiers/accc6843-6831-40db-8ed1-c0b7956c3733/?utm_term=.5b1347e1f292" rel="nofollow">www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1992/07/12/why-perot-was-right-about-americas-missing-soldiers/accc6843-6831-40db-8ed1-c0b7956c3733/?utm_term=.5b1347e1f292</a><br/>**<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/02/28/the-powmia-flag-still-flies-high-despite-questions" rel="nofollow">www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/02/28/the-powmia-flag-still-flies-high-despite-questions</a><br/>***<a href="http://www.miafacts.org/private_sec1.htm" rel="nofollow">www.miafacts.org/private_sec1.htm</a><br/>****<a href="http://www.whale.to/b/gritz.h.html" rel="nofollow">www.whale.to/b/gritz.h.html</a><br/>****<a href="https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/career-advice/military-transition/famous-veteran-chuck-norris.html" rel="nofollow">www.military.com/veteran-jobs/career-advice/military-transition/famous-veteran-chuck-norris.html</a><br/>**<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_553" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_553</a> <br/>**<a href="https://www.politicalresearch.org/1999/02/27/right-woos-left/" rel="nofollow">www.politicalresearch.org/1999/02/27/right-woos-left/</a> <br/>**<a href="https://www.mixedmartialarts.com/vault/exotics/bruce-lee-investigated-manson-murders" rel="nofollow">www.mixedmartialarts.com/vault/exotics/bruce-lee-investigated-manson-murders</a><br/>***<a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/fort-benning-school-of-the-americas/" rel="nofollow">letterboxd.com/pd187/list/fort-benning-school-of-the-americas/</a><br/><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/04/archives/exberet-says-he-killed-agent-on-orders-of-cia-exberet-says-he.html" rel="nofollow">www.nytimes.com/1971/04/04/archives/exberet-says-he-killed-agent-on-orders-of-cia-exberet-says-he.html</a> <br/>****<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Court-Martial-Robin-Moore/dp/B000H6JPLM" rel="nofollow">www.amazon.com/Court-Martial-Robin-Moore/dp/B000H6JPLM</a><br/>****INS criminal investigator Richard Smith’s report stated that an LA law enforcement agency had a female informant who averred that the English Satanist group had commissioned Manson to kill Sharon Tate.

<br><b>756: Tartarus 2005</b>
<br><p>since the 20th century, "aliens" have changed their stories to delude us into believing them. one example is that before we went to space or sent up satellites "aliens" would claim to be from planets like mars or jupiter in our solar system but as time went on we learned more about our closest neighbors we realized nothing could live on a planet like jupiter so "aliens" changed their stories &amp; now they claim to be from other solar systems &amp; star clusters such as andromeda or pleiades. do not be convinced by their story of life beyond earth - these beings &amp; the "objects" they take flight in are not from the stars, they are from a dimension on top of our own. our beliefs about evolution, extraterrestrial life and interstellar travel have made us susceptible to their deception. there as evidence suggesting these beings are the same ones behind the matrix prisondimension and the whole reincarnation trap. all of the mirrors in your home are used by them to watch us &amp; our planet/reality; next time you look in a mirror, look past it, "behind" yourself and you will see. when the 4G and 5G wi-fi program is shut down (it will be eventually), you will see these entities roaming our planet freely. as cosmic frequencies blocked by wi-fi upgrade the DNA in all lifeforms, this will give you the ability to detect beings ruling our world, see, sense or both. darkness = lack of, including lack of perfection. i have been seeing them since 1992 but that is an exception to the matrix (its not a 100% assimilation, it has flaws due to "lack of"). have you noticed your memories seeming "off" lately? i recently discovered a correlation between exposure to 24/7 wi-fi and the surge of "mandela effects" back in 2010. today my mind is in a struggle to escape this matrix, like the struggle of prey stuck in a spider's web. they say the more you struggle in a web the more stuck you get. have you been feeling sick and tired, even after sleeping all night? we have individual consciousness, but to them our consciousness is collective - these beings come in dreams, not just to one of us, but all of us. ive seen people in trance-like states, not asleep but "channelling" these beings, absorbing obvious deception through these messages, in incredible pain. ever repeated something and couldnt remember where you heard it? "extraterrestrials" are demons in alien skin and their dimension is hell. please watch this film &amp; learn the truth!</p>

<br><p>look i feel real bad about giving this the same rating as US but i had the time of my life in a half-empty regal theater behind a screaming toddler who i can only assume is a huge dennis quaid fan. quaid in his age/mileage has developed a gnarled, trembling swagger and this surprisingly artful cape fearish thriller (shot by daniel pearl) gives him over an hour to develop his bizarro character against half of the cast of steve harvey's THINK LIKE A MAN, specifically straw-dog pushover michael ealy and meagan good with an unflattering anakin podracer bowlcut. writer david loughrey started his career working with quaid on DREAMSCAPE before moving thru shit like star trek v (!) and passenger 57 to become last decade's go-to guy for weird, fetishy interracial home invasion thrillers, writing both OBSESSED (the beyonce vs ali larter flick when b wasnt better than this kinda thing) and labute's queasy LAKEVIEW TERRACE, but the racial/political dynamics of the premise stay mostly unexplored aside from some "city boy" gun squabble and quaid donning a MAGAesque cap for the finale. wavering between tragic/pathetic and impish, grinchlike camp, i cannot oversell how strange and fun he is to watch in this, whether nervously checking out meagan good's ass or saying "you cant find this on the internet" like a datpiff drop, and the scattered crowd enjoyed hooting &amp; clapping for both his vulnerable creeper tenacity and eventual pushback/comeuppance. ealy's good too, landing between nerdy buppy likability and something almost like (no bullshit) cruise in eyes wide shut - of course we're nowhere near that but i cant believe im even saying it about a movie from the director of (the weirdly similar premised) MEET THE BLACKS! even when this makes a bland pg13 choice or devolves into shaky action it remains watchable for the subtle, weirdly compelling characters and situations, which prob means its gonna be gone from theaters next week to make room for more stupid shit for babies, so, all my unforgettable/unsane/greta-heads, check it out! also this made my thanksgiving horror list 💀🍁🦃🍂</p>

<br><p>FWD: FWD: FWD: Very Cool Story! </p><p>A visionary Texas businessman was trying to build planes in peace, without government regulation. Unfortunately, his girlfriend's family of atheist "socialist" Limousine Liberals told him they don't like to talk about money. "You don't talk about money because you've always had it!" the businessman told the elite Roosevelt Democrats. "Some of us choose to WORK for a living!". The communist family were visibly shaken as the billionaire job creator triumphantly left to build another plane. </p><p>This angered the Liberal establishment and a corrupt New England Senator brought the Texan executive before an investigative committee (witch hunt). The Senator jewishly accused him of failing to comply with his $56 million military contract, but the Senator's job-killing bill was actually motivated by secret back-room deals and crony capitalism (like all government regulations). "Other companies did the same stuff I did" said the businessman. "Why are you singling me out??. He smiled, knowing he was 100% correct. "Mr. Senator I've had enough of your NONSENSE!". The Texan stormed out and everybody in the courtroom stood up &amp; applauded as an eagle flew into the chamber and pecked the Senator's eyes out. That brave billionaire's name? None other than.....

<br><p>from brain damage films, the geniusses who gave us TERROR TOONS, HIP-HOP LOCOS, and SCHIZOPHRENIC: THE WHORE MANGLER (and SUBURBAN SASQUATCH, which this feels like an on-purpose version of) comes this goofy, bloodless cormanesque creature-feature that has basically one joke, which is giving mouthfuls of overwritten, unwieldly dialogue to awkward actors, a joke that fortunately stays pretty funny til the end! kinda like a troma flick for gifted middle-schoolers, theres a nice autumnal vibe &amp; the youth pastor-y star/writer/producer (who unfortunately kinda looks like tucker carlson) wrote the score which never stops almost turning into "forgot about dre", along with some original river-themed rock songs that had me dying. theres too many characters &amp; maybe too much indie-comedy/not enough RIVERBEAST - id say its 20 min too long (this feels like a directors cut) but i understand not wanting to cut anything when every scene proves the kinda quality low-budget movie you can make with no money or resources when you have a really strong idea you stick to. once we passed 80 minutes i started to feel the length of this thing but then the (spoilers) statue reveal at the end is maybe the weirdest, funniest joke in the whole movie. is this mormon? it feels mormon. four stars!!</p>


<br><b>794: The Parallax View</b>
<br><p>this is good n all but i think with conspiracy thrillers i prefer info-dense stories about learning new things to this sorta vague, paranoid spy/action shit - a movie like JFK has a twitchy, curious vibe that mimics the actual psyche of going "down the rabbit hole" so while nobody's ever in any actual personal danger (imagine jim garrison in a car chase!) laurie metcalf sitting at an office table describing a photograph for 8 minutes feels more exciting than anything in this. i guess the political/psychological aspects here are so big &amp; important that it feels cheap to break for a bar fight or clever cinematic trick? file under well-made disinfo</p>


<br><b>795: Oz The Great And Powerful</b>
<br><p>mostly deserves its rep as ARMY OF DARKNESS remade into a nauseating disney blockbuster but even if raimi did this 20 years ago with rubber monkeys and bruce as oz it prob still wouldve been a HOOK-level eyesore with a terrible script. this world of needy, simpering witches who have actual superpowers &amp; yearn for yet another smarmy womanizing white guy savior (fuckin.....JAMES FRANCO) cloned from every other late-00s hollywood-asshole hero (iron man, chris pine kirk, chris pratt guardians, depp in pirates kinda? - that weird shift in kids movie protagonist from innocent/likable superman/luke skywalker to snarky rogueish han solo as the lead cuz uhhhh audiences like han solo so why not make everybody han solo all the time even if theyre wrong for the story &amp; incredibly miscast!!! &amp; prob also a mild pg-13 fuck-you (i mean, "f**k you") backlash to 90s feminism/political correctness &amp; watered-down gentrification of 80s r-rated skirt-chasers) but hes not clever or charismatic enough to play a quicktalking huckster or sell anything that happens besides blandly smirking like a dumbass - it almost works in the b&amp;w throwback circus opening where he's supposed to be a petty, laughable fraud (the least offensive stuff in the film &amp; close to paul auster's mr vertigo) but then we're in this hideous CGI dr seuss minionsworld and dude is straining to gaze with wonder &amp; amazement at a tennis ball thatll get painted with some garish cartoon bullshit while the eternally-oohing danny elfman sugarplum choir twinkles and its just dumb &amp; boring &amp; terrible. the repeated insistence that james franco, i mean franco's character, is more than just a hollow superficial con was the least believable thing in the whole movie! and i kept deeply hating this but then there'd be a crazy smash-zoom or some lil bit of weirdness that'd bring me back in (it does have mila kunis with bangs and a bunch of batwinged baboons who get fucked up on opium) but everything that starts out promising leads to disappointment - like wow, its a trip seeing bruce campbell &amp; greg nicotero in kiddy disney blockbuster opening credits (which look like a 2004 franz ferdinand video) but then bruce shows up for 20 secs with a big fake nose and it sucks! and greg nicotero is only here to put a DIFFERENT big fake nose on mila kunis!! i yelled when i saw tony cox with a big curlicue mustache but hes just really angry and its supposed to be funny?? raimi has always been terrible with black characters and the 2 in this are tony cox as a pissed off munchkin like some shit from EPIC MOVIE and the old dude from hudsucker proxy (2nd unit dir: sam raimi) as the same embarrassing, condescending magical character he played in hudsucker proxy. michelle williams is trying hard (wonder if franco gave tips on how to deal with VENOM) but shes also mostly boring and rachel weisz i dont even know enough to say if shes any good or not til she turns into a deadite and its ok. but nobody is good in this! zack braff is in this! guess how that goes! the whole thing has this stench of television thats deadly for any big immersive fantasy world and none of the legit awe you need - any of the elements that make it a "darker" take on oz just feel like them admitting they cant capture any of that magic in 2013. god, the shit i put up with for sam!</p><p>ok the (spoilers) wicked witch transformation has a lil bit of that ol' raimi magic - we're talkin almost as good as xena warrior princess here - but the decision to have mila kunis doing voiceover off-camera just made me think of meg griffin &amp; also, (spoilers) its a cool touch that mila's watery witch tears leave deep burns/scars down her face but like............. what happens when she takes a piss?</p>

WHY do i keep watching movies with fake EC comix posters??? stop me if youve heard this one - a talky, sarcastic, politically IN-correct (!!) slasher-comedy decked out with corny retro touches and a quippy misogynist killer bumping off off smirky horror nerds who yak about "blowies" + how their situation is "just like a bad horror movie"!!!!! how do these wannabe chris seavers feel about toiling over homemade microbudget labors-of-love with the same tedious sense of humor &amp; worldview as corporate product designed to help ryan reynolds sell mikes hard lemonade??? that said i liked the fake trailer for an amish horror movie</p>
<br><b>810: My Bloody Valentine 2009</b>
<br><p>watched this on v-day of course and i was hyped cuz i hadnt seen it in like 5 years and remembered nothing but dope shit so i looked on here and 2015 i gave it TWO AND A HALF STARS??? turns out all the sicko kills &amp; tom atkins cussing &amp; p.o.v. fulci eye trauma i remember is still there but disconnected from the other 85% of the movie like some ripoff troma release sprinkling occasional crowd-pleasing gore shots into a generic w.bush-era cw teen drama (the main guy is a dawsons creek vet whose character name sounds like the n-word and i have no idea how that made it from script into theatrical release) with a [spoiler] haute tension-esque movie-ruining twist and one of the blandest, least defined final girls in slasher history. also anybody who survived this western PA mining town massacre is 100% dead from fentanyl now</p>


<br><b>811: The List 2000</b>
<br><p>mildly-satisfying tvish thriller with a dumbass SHOCKING TWIST and the sadly eternal theme that a bunch of rich old politics guys can do whatever shitty thing they want. prob rated higher than most cuz i like this sorta thing - it never gets too nutso (there was as scene where i thought paunchy supreme court nominee ryan oneal, looking like the lead in a christian movie, got a severed dick stuffed in his mouth, but i think its supposed to be an ox tongue)(?) but its watchable and the 90s mark snow-y score is some shit id LOVE to hear lord infamous rap over. also my ex-rental VHS of this is banana yellow why?</p>


<br><b>812: Pompeii</b>
<br><p>very dumb with 2 bland leads and 2 many lazy cliches (both black characters are servants/slaves who [SPOILER] sacrifice themselves for whites) and hilariously bad foley/sound work (all recognizable stock fx isolated in empty space like one of those youtube shreds videos i heard the ubiquitous "creaking door" AND the "breaking pottery" effect from wet hot american summer) but theres a lot of wild ass crazy visual/action cinema w/ some great actors (esp a smirking, grinchlike kiefer named some hilarious shit like "senator quentinius atticus corvus") and i respect em for doing this goofy peplum/sword n sandals crap 100% straight in 2014 so............check it out</p>

<br><p>too many talky criminals &amp; not enough alien parasites but its all fun &amp; the end of this made me laff too hard to care. the most horrifying thing in this movie is repeated use of the midwestern "positive anymore" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_anymore" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_anymore</a></p>

<br><p>a flashy late 90s georgia/carolina-set screwball roadtrip romcom shot like a big beat video off mtv's amp should be undeniably my thing but the leads are 2 of my alltime least faves and the screenplay is 100% dogshit. i mostly watched it cuz i knew it had savannah's beautiful <a href="https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/336?offset=5" rel="nofollow">WORLD GLOBE GAS STORAGE TANK</a> which they get out the way early on (in new jersey????) and the rest is just these bland, charmless assholes mugging thru planes/trains/automobiles type goofs stuck in the worst type of "thinkin bout relationships" movie. all this fake deep shit about marriage anxiety and infidelity coming out 3 months before EYES WIDE SHUT over here making romance insights on the level of clerks 2-era kevin smith?? some great weirdo kitsch locations and sometimes almost looks like a tony scott movie but in the middle of these cool shots you have to suffer thru confused, uptight square ben (his character also named ben on some "50 cent as air marshall 50 cent" shit) and quirky free spirit sandra awkwardly flirting like an unpleasant brother and sister &amp; doing shitty k-mart product placement. meanwhile they waste actually funny/charming people like maura tierney, sitting around sulking by the phone and getting serenaded with a phil collins song by the guy from suddenly susan who killed himself 3 days after this came out. this movie wastes steve zahn. steve zahn! theres a scene towards the end where a strapped for cash sandra offers to strip at a backwater south carolina dive bar but - surprise! - its a gay bar! they got inside without noticing, somehow! and the resulting affleck striptease is so inert, so anti-climactic, so unfunnily, unsatisfyingly acted &amp; shot &amp; edited its like a 5 minute masterclass in how not to make a movie.</p>

<br><b>823: Close Calls</b>
<br><p>look idk if this is 4&amp;1/2 stars for anybody else but it feels right to me... a manic psychotronic sleep-deprived arkansas slasher drug nightmare that kept surprising me over its 2-hour (!) runtime, even halfway thru when i thought it was gonna turn into another girl tied to a chair movie they switched it up like 8 or 9 more times. its a mess but theres always a vision behind it, occasionally dumb but whenever i started to get annoyed there'd be some new bizarro angle id never expect. also i watched this with commercials on tubi tv so let me just say A MESSAGE TO THE HATERS: MY FACE, MY DECISION.

<br><b>830: Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde 1920</b>
<br><p>lol mr hyde a freak</p>
<br><b>831: Terror Eyes</b>
<br><p>i think alot about the different kinds of enjoyment &amp; expectations involved in being someone who mostly watches shitty low budget movies and one of the things "normal" viewers never get to experience is the satisfaction of seeing cool shit from the poster actually show up in the movie... anybody watching only big hollywood crap has no concept of being 50 min deep in an apartment-bound s.o.v. terminator ripoff or 80s italo creature feature and realizing they actually have the gross puppet or cyborg barbarian you assumed was only airbrushed for the video box!! anyway id never heard of this til last week but the monster on the box is one of the greatest things ive ever seen (i laffed for 20 secs straight when i found it &amp; immediately shelled out ten bucks) so when he showed up halfway thru in the actual movie i wanted to jump up &amp; do the ed lover dance (the rest is good too)</p>


<br><b>832: What Happens In The Mountains Should Stay In The Mountains</b>
<br><p>super watchable no-budget north georgia bigfoot goof that clocks in less than an hour but really captures the lazy feel of 70s post-boggy creek flicks with authentic locals ("what up gary!") and slow animal &amp; nature footage. not a ton of squatch but theres "ultimate bigfoot hunter" BUCK SWINGER played by stacey alexander (who also wrote, directed and edited) andsome decent rockabilly music by.... stacey alexander. im pretty sure they got the title off a wooden plaque at a gift shop. recommended!</p>
<br><b>833: House On Bare Mountain</b>
<br><p>im glad the mummy and the wolfman also got to be in ORGY OF THE DEAD cuz this movie sucked</p>
<br><b>834: The Cat From Outer Space</b>
<br><p>Paw-ject Mew Book</p><p>not great but pretty engaging/endearing, with a cast made up entirely of guys from hogans heroes, M*A*S*H &amp; gomer pyle u.s.m.c. (plus roddy macdowell). i liked seeing this much drinking, cigar-smoking and gambling in a kiddy flick, sandy duncan is really cute and theres a weird esoteric/paranoia vibe that i guess was just in the air in the 70s even in shit like this</p>
<br><b>835: Heroes For Hire</b>
<br><p>this is an ok action movie not nearly cool enough for the title i watched it under (HELL RAIDERS!!!!) but "heroes for hire" gets across how much it feels like a ninja-based episode of the a-team. the most interesting/fun thing about it is the end credits where im pretty sure the filipino crew just pulled as many american-sounding names as they could from u.s. newspapers so you get party guest "katherine graham" production designer "george will" (and kidnappers played by "steven king" and "tony clifton") like that japanese baseball game where dudes were named "todd bonzalez" and "bobson dugnutt"</p>
<br><b>836: Mindwarp</b>

<br><b>837: Strange Beings</b>

<br><b>838: Home The Horror Story</b>
<br><p>richard beymer (MY GIRL 2, SILENT NIGHT DEADLY NIGHT 3) &amp; grace zabriskie (GALAXY OF TERROR, TRANCERS: CITY OF LOST ANGELS) star in this cheap, hysterical family satire that feels like if todd solondz directed terror toons. all the blunt shots at christians, homophobes, racists &amp; republicans wont impress anybody cool &amp; insulated enough to think saying the obvious is uncouth but the last 20 years have only upheld &amp; intensified the way this shit felt at the time, like when a cop (with the dark mustache/light hair combo of sam hyde or joseph farah of world net daily) plans to run for office on an anti-immigrant campaign of "compassionate nazism". you gotta have an appetite for twitchy grotesquerie &amp; screeching ugly camp but the surrealistic nightmare vibe gets legit disturbing &amp; nutso beymer gives a wild, fearless performance - its not every day you get to see the lead of WEST SIDE STORY yank dong &amp; wipe the goop on his face. proudly watched on tubi tv, where else???</p>


<br><b>839: The Terror Within</b>

<br><b>846: Blood Fest</b>
<br><p>smug, knowing "gotta play by the slasher rules" meta-horror can get fucked but this has a breezy energy i gotta admire. theres a fun goosebumps/are you afraid of the dark vibe lacking from a lot of horror comedies nowadays (the whole cabin-in-the-westworld plot is basically "one day at horrorland" in everything but name) but the writer/director, a middle aged alcoholic-looking alamo drafthouse beardo who i can imagine like, dabbing on tiktok to promote this, nails the film's problem when his top-hatted nerd villain complains that horror has been commodified &amp; defanged - "we've made lovecraft into a coloring book," in a movie that does exactly that. the worst part is theres a basic competence &amp; relish in doing all this genre stuff that i really wish was applied towards an actual real horror movie! instead this is somewhere between that sitcommy piece of shit "the final girls" and a generic, mid-budget gingerdead man 2 (they even do the "serious actor ashamed of his shitty horror roles" bit, prob my fav thing in the movie) which of course removes anything fun or interesting about gingerdead man 2. most of the gags are entry-level refs (except a cult of thorn joke i loved) or jamie-kennedy-in-scream "usually, this part is when THIS happens" (thing happens), characters are either annoying (all the dudes) or non-existent (all the women) and the whole thing has the sickly digital sheen &amp; quirky tvtropes flop sweat of Netflix Original McG's The Babysitter, but still theres something that makes this hard to completely dislike. oh well!</p>

<br><p>manic, demonic christian puppet bullshit about the lost years of jesus christ starring "peepers" (?) and "bunny bigword" (???). tired-sounding kids sing a weird synth-calypso song about "cutie" jesus and his "bumps and sores"(!). a cursed relic of frantic editing &amp; heavy cult initiation/brain washing/MKULTRA vibe. uncle jim, the creepy fred armisen looking host i just googled &amp; found is the proud result of ex-gay conversion, explains jesus is your "forever friend" and when you die you live in his house. you can practically smell the evil fuming off this thing</p>
<br><b>849: Hi 8 Horror Independent 8</b>
<br><p>hi-8, ranked:</p><p>i. THE TAPE (tony masiello) pretty much perfect, especially considering horror about horror nerds sucks 99% of the time - this one's moody, absurd fun with kaleidoscopic creepshow lighting, characters i didnt hate, an occult demon cassette (s/o patrick pryor) &amp; some incredible gut-splattery "howd they do it" gore fx. itd be a great intro for somebody who doesnt know anything about s.o.v. &amp; wants to learn what it is AND see a short, good example of the genre. so funny/accurate how the lost vhs "BLOODGASM" is just a bunch of todd sheets gizzard-fondling and nothing else. i love this!</p><p>ii. A VERY BAD SITUATION (marcus koch) this is shot like whole ass but its a decent-enough garagebound ufo invasion riff on the notld basement and the messy headasplosion alien that shows up like 3 seconds before the end is pretty cool (you can see it on the poster). "s.o.v. sci-fi" is the closest description of my fav genre thats only ever good in my head and this is definitely..........that. so, not bad!</p><p>iii. GANG THEM STYLE (ron bonk) i started out sure it was the chris seaver entry (stupid, unfunny reference humor) but when i got to the end &amp; there wasnt any racist/rape stuff i realized it couldnt be. this nostalgia action parody is SUPER dumb with some epic-80s-for-the-win stuff youd see on a tshirt at target but i laffed a few times (counting the steps to the van) and i loved the incredibly shitty ripoff of the escape from new york theme. a triumph!</p><p>iv. THE REQUEST (todd sheets) its the boringest sheets has ever been but i dug it for delving further into his interest in art bell &amp; other talk-radio guys. not v professional (its todd sheets!) but surprisingly classy for the director &amp; genre. i love todd sheets. </p><p>v. SWITCHBLADE INSANE (tim ritter) - miserable start but grows into something a lil weirder &amp; more interesting than i expected. ive only seen KILLING SPREE which i love the look of but really confirms my theory that something like 70% of s.o.v. horror guys are making shit to work out their seriously fucked-up issues with women and this has a bunch of weird divorced-guy mens rights serial killer crap but its being said/done by.... A WOMAN???? woooahaoaoah! anyway its kinda interesting &amp; the acting is better than any of the ones i put below it</p><p>vi. THE SCOUT (brad sykes) 9 minutes of an annoying couple bickering around the desert and like 20 seconds of typical s.o.v. makeup/gore fx. its refreshing to spend the entire thing outside in a bright-ass sunlight and not some bedroom with hefty bags on the windows but, yeah. pointless &amp; draggy yet (unlike everything below this) impossible to dislike.</p><p>vii. NO BUDGET FILMS PRESENTS (brad sykes) this is a wraparound that does nothing to glue the pieces together its just edited between shorts for no reason after youve forgotten what was happening when we left off. its fine. </p><p>viii. THICKER THAN WATER (donald farmer) kinda like the tim ritter segment but more boring &amp; confusing. i would vote for a presidential candidate who promised a ban on s.o.v. horror movies about tying up &amp; torturing women. maybe next time!</p><p>ix. GENRE BENDING (sigh, chris seaver) actually starts out ok with a goofy peeper &amp; some backyard location work (i love seeing peoples backyard swimming pools in s.o.v.) but immediately it turns into the same ol' chris seaver bullshit. remember when i said "racist/rape stuff"?? thats what you get!! fuck this guy!!!</p><p>ok, thats hi-8 ranked</p>

<br><b>853: Hotel Artemis</b>
<br><p>why does the main character in future movies always have to be into some bullshit old timey crap (in this case, classic rock)?? its such a cheap way to connect with the present audience &amp; for once id love to see a future protagonist who thinks everything from our time is lame and old and dumb. this goofy lil deviant-art page of a movie is like the flawed humanist cousin to the gory, cynical UPGRADE, a one-off cyberjunk crime thriller with a carpenter siege premise that doesnt really pay off and brazil-ian art direction on some SLIPSTREAM/PHANTOM2040/CIRCUITRY MAN shit (but 2018 so throw snowpiercer + john wick + the purge and [some videogames i dont play videogames] in the mix). its hilariously miscast - charlie day embarrasses himself channeling, i dunno, jon polito (rip!!!)? as a disney movie crook, but i think goldblum (doing his tired "now, uh, listen here, kiddo" schtick) and, sigh, zachary quinto (maybe the worst, most unpleasant actor of his generation) as father &amp; son gangsters (???) is the hardest to watch. meanwhile theres solid, brawny work from heavies with fancy gentrified neighborhood bakery names like bautista and boutella, wistful character turns from sterling k. brown and DORIS GIRTH HERSELF jenny slate, and then in the middle of all this, a great, unshowy jodie foster performance. its all very 90s but also weirdly mid 2000s - in its own corny greenscreen steampunk way it could almost pass for a SIN CITY mockbuster made in that eon between katrina &amp; occupy. theres some dumb/confusing stuff that didnt click for me but the movie's wachowskian sense of empathy &amp; concern for the pains &amp; injustice of society really moved this beyond what could've been ugly, shallow kitsch. a good b-movie!</p>

AND its product placement! this has ppl (cole, hannibal, cena) &amp; jokes that i like but its visually whatever and full of bad apato-mckayian improv they simply refuse to cut away from. i loved the kids but thought the parents got off way too easy for all the bullshit they pulled and as much as i appreciate em (cena!) ive never wished for an american pie 2 thats like 70% eugene levy. ok dont tell anybody this but i think i watch too many fucked up movies where ppl are super shitty to each other &amp; like knife-fuck each others corpses or whatever that ive rewired my brain to get teary-eyed any time ppl in a movie are nice to each other and this ended up charming me at the end. also i watched this after MADELINE'S MADELINE and they have a LOT in common!</p>

<br><p>gotta admire the confidence of making like 25 actual movies with zero original ideas (this is the guy behind the full moon reject killer doll series ROBERT + a bunch of other dumb garbage) &amp; while the craft (cameras, shots, lighting) is ok, the fx mostly struggle (not many filmmakers have the audacity to show a terrible cgi headshot in center frame AND slow-motion) and characterization &amp; acting is universally bad, with brits struggling to do accents both german (phonetically, i bet) &amp; american (redneck grunts dont say privacy like prih-va-cee). yeah its embarrassing to see a ww2 movie made by someone whose only knowledge of ww2 is inglourious basterds but theres something really funny about 808 mafia's tarantino having his scripts &amp; characters &amp; action beats ripped from context and plagiarized ("remixed" as he'd say) like hes done with so many forgotten euro genre movies. the opening scene of this is a tense [citation needed] basement tavern standoff with additional dialogue copped from pulp fiction, later we get a ripoff of the phrenology bullshit &amp; john legend song ("FREEDOM!") from django. theres some full metal jacket shit in there too, looking like it was shot on a golf course. the holocaust allusions are pretty offensive and ignore everything about judaism &amp; tattoos just to pay off a stupid, tasteless riff on a jeepers creepers 2 gag. as everybody else already said, the "werewolves" (plural cuz there's 2) dont show up til the last 15 minutes of the movie and look like shitty halloween masks with big loose eyeholes. theres some amateur craft project nazi flags with shakily-drawn swastikas and a hitler who looks like hes from a mad tv sketch. nazis speak subtitled german to american soldiers but hitler speaks english in private convos with mengele. the influence of david decoteau's puppet master iii continues to loom over all of cinema.</p>

<br><b>866: Cynthia 2018</b>
<br><p>just to get it out of the way this is a dumb-as-hell troma-y henenlotter-wannabe jammed with predictably raunchy zingers &amp; corny horrorcon cameos featuring like 4 songs by ICP-adjacent rapper necro (playing on the headphones of a tatted-up hospital janitor, as god intended) &amp; produced by something (a magazine? website??) called, sigh, GIRLS &amp; CORPSES so maybe its soft bigotry of low expectations but i had a great time with it! scout "outta" compton has a genuinely weird energy i love, whether she's shooting the shit with her crass yogababe sister, bumming around a filthy mcmansion scooping up haagen-dasz with nacho chips (scout absolutely HOUSES some snacks in this) or flipping out to protect her mutant uterine cyst baby thats (spoilers) eating her husband's boyfriend. after 3-4 patchy scenes it settles into low-effort/grossout fun, with a veiny, farting puppet that had me laffing out loud every minute it was onscreen. its a tonal mess, uneven as shit &amp; doesnt really have an ending but it does have a loopy lynn lowry performance and a baby murders a guy in a bouncy castle so if youre a big dumbass like me check it out</p>


<br><b>867: Magic Christmas Tree</b>
<br><p>this has gotta be the xmas movie that most feels like a herschell gordon lewis and not only is it giving me life but i am also both here for it and living for it</p><p>[communicating magnetically with a tree is like seeking an aura - the more capacitance in your body, the more likely you are to become sensitive, because you become more coherent mathematically. sitting under an old growth tree predicts your likelihood of clairvoyance - the principle being, the closer the grain structure of the wood, the more the fractal density of the charge and, therefore, self-awareness of the tree electrically. the word "tree" is just our mammalian name for a fractal branching algorithm of conscious electricity. the fir trees' branches &amp; roots are responsible for communication - like in our nerves, they transmit chemical and electrical signals to "brainstorm" and impart knowledge. the more fractal the tree, the closer the grain structure of the wood, the more paramagnetic it is. each branch junction (where one stem splits, or bifurcates) is a psychic node and each branch is an internode. the fern tree was the first fractal, and oaks and pines are classically known to be highly magnetic. the fractal forest is a portal to access our spiritual geometry. the druids worshiped this fractal - single pillars made of tree trunks called irmensul (giant column) representing the "tree of the universe" were set up on hilltops by germanic tribes. the most venerated irmensul in what is now westphalia was cut down by the christianizing charlemagne in 772. in the 6th century pope saint gregory encouraged proselytizing christians to graft their theology onto pre-existing pagan rites and sacred places, and in the case of pagan tree cults this involved the destruction of the sacred grove or the cutting down of their sacred tree, so a church could be built on the same site, co-opting the magnetic energy. the process effectively christianized the powers &amp; energies of the original pagan site. the medieval gothic cathedral of chartres was built on a magnetic site which was sacred to the druids, and acorns, oak twigs, and tree idols are built into the sculptural decorations on the cathedral alluding to the original druidic oak grove. in genesis, two trees - the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil - grow at the center of the garden of eden. the wood used for the cross in the crucifixion of christ was from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and when adam was buried at jerusalem three trees grew out of his mouth to mark the magnetic center of the earth. now we're able to analyze spectrums at the charge at the base of the trees and find trees which are more responsive to human emotion than others. ones that are larger, older trees that still have a lot of energy and have been relatively pristine and not exposed to too much magnetic/wifi pollution. a living pine tree will be very fractal, even though it is a soft tree. its evergreen nature is known to keep away illness and spiritual/reptilian influence. the vikings knew evergreens like the norway spruce represented the spirit of the sun god balder that repelled snakes &amp; serpents (the romans celebrated december 25th as the birth of their sun god, mithra). when seeking communication with a fir, look for a tree that is attracting life force. you can feel it pulse under your hand. the same way a sacro-cranial practitioner can feel the long wave currents in your spine, you feel the pulsing of the tree. heavily treed oxygen-rich environments are the only place you can do this. good luck!]</p>

<br><p>not a good movie, but i fear the tall jawa</p>
<br><b>886: Big Legend</b>
<br><p>better made than other squatch movies but loses most of what makes the goofy cheapo ones fun. beautiful nature photography over generic symphonic score but its all way too serious and bigfoot is mean &amp; mindless &amp; violent with none of the placid, dharmic serenity or konglike characterization i require. main army ranger dude makes logan marshall green look charismatic and the movie spends 90% of its runtime with just him doing silent arnold-in-predator stuff. cameos from adrienne barbaeu and a very old looking (spoilers cuz i didnt know he was in it, even tho hes listed in the cast) lance henriksen in the final 4 minutes with a sequelbait/shared-universe offer to join his bigfoot hunting team (???) which is like a dumb joke youd make about a movie like this but honestly went a long way towards redeeming it. i bet real deal squatchers love being taken this seriously (the bigfoot expedition museum in cherry log GA has a display with every bigfoot movie listed on it and im sure they winced having to include shit like SUBURBAN SASQUATCH &amp; polonia classic AMONG US next to all the boggy creekses) but somewhere between the solemn, joyless tone of this &amp; jokey gorilla costume troma shit is the squatch i know</p>


<br><b>887: Space Is The Place</b>
<br><p>when i was a kid i loved space, which meant i loved NASA. i mailed away for their free pamphlets and kept a big yellow folder of astronaut photos and rocket/shuttle blueprints and doodled their (old, good) logo on everything i owned. the cold war was over &amp; i thought the apollo program was a great human achievement, not a bunch of repatriated nazi scientists enacting cold war revenge on commies for killing hitler. when i got into rap &gt;into soul &gt;into afrofuturism i learned the first black person in space was arnaldo tamayo mendez, an afro-cuban cosmonaut who took soyuz 38 to salyut 6, not anybody from NASA or america. living thru the post-9/11 death march of the military-industrial complex that launched project mercury, learning about soviets in space let me feel joy &amp; awe again. i thought about all this watching sun ra, a genius who lived &amp; died in birmingham alabama, born in the shadow of the huntsville rocket program &amp; space center overseen by nazi war criminal wernher von braun. sun ra made this in 1974, america basking in the afterglow of six manned landings, 1 year after gravitys rainbow. he had racist nasa teaming up with hoover's fbi (and THE DEVIL) in some coded 3rd-eye murmur of the ugly, real history - a psychedelic/philosophic avant garde blaxplo where his saturnian alter-destiny looked up at a huntsville crawling with v2 scientists who dodged the gallows of nuremberg and built himself a cosmos without jim crow or the american war machine. i love this movie.</p>

<br><b>895: Midnight Cop</b>
<br><p>my vidmark tape has a full-length pink lingerie morgan fairchild pinup on the back like some trashy 90s body chemistry sequel but this is more wry euro-noir moodpiece, a foggy sax-soaked existential giallo ep of columbo or stacy keach's mike hammer. kinky, beatdown armin mueller stahl does smash some toilets and tell a guy he'll fuck his nose up so bad he'll have to sniff coke with his asshole but he mostly just bums around weird-looking germans &amp; character actors (inc. a career-best frank stallone &amp; the always-welcome michael york). its wistful &amp; distinctive &amp; reminded me of verhoeven's 4th man or fassbinder's cyberpunk detective goof kamikaze 89 (HIGH praise) so im gonna recommend it</p>


<br><b>896: Nancy</b>
<br><p>dunno why everybody in these art movies always talks monotone with lonngg pauses instead of annoyingly yammering constantly like everybody irl BUT this is real good anyway - nancy is one of those characters like marty jackitansky in buzzard who sticks with you like a real person &amp; this is full of hopeless, subtle truths (loved her coworker's multi-tupperware raw veggie lunch) and i feel like i'll be thinking about it for a while</p>
<br><b>897: Curse Of The Mayans</b>
<br><p>its a well-made mid-budget mexican indie horror about a bunch of ancient aliens/coast to coast a.m. stuff so, yeah i liked it. looks more like a real movie than most of these (+1 for not being found footage) and i was real impressed by the mayan recreations until i realized they were filmed at some corny tourist ceremony. zecharia sitchin/von daniken crap can be racist when its white guys colonizersplaining other civilizations but i guess its a lil better if the movie is made by ppl about their own history/culture? idk lotsa those ufo guys think da vinci was an reptoid (theres an ancient aliens ep about the founding fathers!). this starts off kinda slow with actual character development but i didnt mind cuz everybody was good and when the last 20 min gets weird youve almost forgotten what kinda movie it is (theres incredible closing narration thats like something from heavens gate cult initiation). the one white dude steve wilcox (NUDIST COLONY OF THE DEAD, SCANNER COP II: THE SHOWDOWN) looks exactly like the guy who hosts my local ufo group and gets the line of the movie, "there are no insignificant pyramids, you idiot"</p>


<br><b>898: Revenge 2017</b>
<br><p>woo... pretty gnarly stuff! this got burdened as being one of those Movies We Need Right Now where its like a civic duty to see it which is a shame cuz its actually a dope lil crowd-pleaser that prob doesnt "work" as elevated art thesis/deconstruction for a24 people who dont watch normal revenge/vigilante flicks (not even revenge, its a survival movie). and im not saying it doesnt have interesting shit to say but i saw ppl comparing it to raw i guess cuz theyre both gory genre riffs from french ladies distro'd to the criterion crowd but while that was way more ponderous &amp; fartsy (still fine) this delivers the goods better than 90% of direct-to-redbox action shit ive seen. also felt like there was a lot of bug abuse in this but im sure the bugs are ok.</p>


<br><b>899: Brutal Bigfoot</b>
<br><p>coast to coast am vet/irl bigfoot hoaxer tom biscardi says this region of arkansas has "78 pound raccoons" and i spent the rest of the movie waiting to see one. later at a pizza place a guy talks about his dad shooting a raccoon that was "75, 70 pounds" (!) and another guy goes "that's the size of a german shepherd!". boring fake bigfoot hunters attempt an original (fictional) idea with the concept of an irradiated, nuke-mutated squatch, using the abandoned SEFOR reactor site outside fayetteville (or, at least, the fence around it) as a sorta-creative location, but none of this matters if you dont have an onscreen bigfoot. how does the guy who makes bigfoot hoaxes not have a bigfoot in his bigfoot movie???? he does have footage of a swarming anthill and spiderwebbed trees tho! this of course claims to be 100% real recovered found footage but theres scenes of people by themselves shot in the 3rd person and a sex scene (???) so who gives a shit</p>


<br><b>900: Shock O Rama</b>
<br><p>still charming but not as consistently great as i remembered - stop-motion junkyard fight is actually p dumb and misty mundae wraparound has some fun/lowkey feminist stuff but also bad unironic sexism &amp; groaner meta-gags, the same kinda self-indulgent backpatting fluent-in-snark/sarcastic-comment-loading stuff that dribbles from the powerbook of cocky hack joss whedon. but that final segment in the sleep clinic (no spoilers) is so weird &amp; creative &amp; incredible it maintains the 4 1/2 star rating &amp; earns the title of.....

<br><p>shot-on-video vampire trash from (where else) western pennsylvania, mostly at a doofusy dive bar covered in horror stickers run by a roughneck beardo barkeep giving the only believable performance. this takes itself pretty seriously, which i liked, but the (obvious) director/star (who talks like the smart guy on a TGIF show) and his crazy bloodsucker ex are way worse than the already low standard for this kinda shit &amp; manage to drag out a movie with a 51 minute runtime. every exterior scene is shot day-for-night with a shitty blue filter and, in the high point of the movie, a pickup truck reveals it has 2 digital lens flares for headlights, driving round the woods like a vagabond blingee</p>

<br><p>the reptilian and other entities who manipulate our world by possessing "human" bodies operate in frequencies between the 3rd and 4th densities. these dimensions are called "hidden spaces and planes unknown to man" in the (apparently) ancient emerald atusha tablets. for simplicity, i refer to this "between world" as the lower fourth dimension, and it is from here that they police our vibrational prison - the "matrix" - and seek to addict &amp; restrict us to the dense physical senses. this world was once far less dense than it is today, and the "fall" down the frequencies, caused by the manipulation of incarnate consciousness and DNA infiltration, has made it so much more difficult to maintain a multi-dimensional connection while in physical form. we are now in a cycle of change when the vibration of this "world" will be raised out of dense physicality and return to where it once was - in doing so, the reptilians ability to manipulate our physical form will be removed (which has them panicking to prevent this shift that opens the vibrational "prison" door). reptilians and other manipulating entities exist only just outside the frequency range of our physical senses - their own physical form has broken down and they can no longer reproduce, thus they infiltrate the human form and use that to exist and control in this dimension. they chose the earth for this infiltration - especially los angeles, california - because it most resembles in vibrations the "location" from which they originate. these reptilians are addicted to the dense physical "world" and the sensations it offers and they have no desire to advance higher. their aim is to stop the earth and incarnate humanity from making the shift from dense physical prison into multi-dimensional paradise. from what i understand, our dense physical world is caught in a manufactured time "loop", in which "time" is a circle, constantly repeating itself - note that the ancient symbol for "infinity" is the snake swallowing its own tail. the pentagram of satanism is also symbolic of this unbroken "time" cycle, the vibrational prison. the period we are now experiencing has, therefore, been played out before. we are just at that point again in the repeating circle or cycle, like a rat running one of those wheels in a cage. no matter how fast it runs, it keeps covering the same ground. what we need to do is break the "time" circle and thus the prison. we are now in that part of the circle that is most vulnerable to this because of the vibrational changes taking place in this part of the universe, and this is why the control of humans has tightened so rapidly in this period - they are doing everything they can to defend their prison from the awakening of the inmates. "orange vampires" is critical to that.</p>


<br><b>910: The South Will Rise Again</b>
<br><p>this rednexxploitation splattershlock makes 2000 maniacs look like gone with the friggin wind!! a senator (?) with a biker stache goes on public access tv and does matt foley air quotes declaring an "immediate ban" on the rebel flag (in 2006!) so a bunch of plastic halloween yard decoration corpses in confederate uniforms (and duane allman!!) sprout from the dirt and get fake-blood fucked up by a dude with a knife made from the bones of ulysses s. grant (!), all read to children from a big leatherbound book called ZOMBIE LEGENDS OF THE SOUTH. its the cheapest, dumbest country boy trash but never feels meanspirited (or racist!) and some of it gets so abstract &amp; weird its some kinda accidental art. also features a hilarious end credits theme that sounds like its from a hallmark movie where a kid learns to believe in christmas again. recommended!</p>

<br><b>915: Woody Woodpecker 2017</b>
<br><p>"ever see THE BIRDS? its HILARIOUS" - woody woodpecker</p><p>the poster makes this look like A TALKING CAT?!? but hack director alex zamm (THE BOGUS WITCH PROJECT, R.L. STINE'S THE HAUNTING HOUR, BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA 2) has made something manic &amp; uneasy, shot thru a plastic, oversaturated digital glaze with more of the precarious cult-movie feel of a cynical MUNCHIE sequel or some desert storm-era shit like A GNOME NAMED GNORM than recent cute kiddy crap. business jerk lawyer dad who looks like chris pine in the wet hot american summer sequel and his xanny-popping brazillian gf (quote: "i need a xanny") show up in the backwoods home of a talking, laughing, toddler-sized bird, his beak dappled with subtle red freckles that look almost like blood spatter, who says anybody who comes "near his tree" deserves to "almost get" killed, and proceeds to act on this while the script, when not doing hashtag-epic-fail jokes, gets almost clever about it, declaring woody the incarnation of a native american trickster god (really) maybe too much but moving along quick enough to not get annoyed with it. here's some of the horrific shit in this:</p><p>-woody screaming "heeeeeeeeres woody!" over psycho stabs, leaping into bed like a night terror (the bird's only other character reference is DIRTY HARRY - "feel lucky, punk?" kubrick was obsessed with woody &amp; "wanted to include him in every film" he made but got refused &amp; had to settle for a tv playing roadrunner in the shining &amp; a bugs bunny xmas special in eyes wide shut... still, you can see the bird's influence on the gleeful, symphonic mayhem of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE reflected back here) (the psycho/bates riff returns in a scene of visibly-aroused taxidermists salivating at the idea of possessing a stuffed woody)</p><p>-a gas leak murder attempt (censored on the uk dvd as "dangerous imitable behaviour") that ends with a tinder hookup joke as woody giggles that he'll "swipe left" on the burned, traumatized woman, pausing the film to smirk at the camera like FUNNY GAMES</p><p>-woody eats a bowl of beans and farts out his famous laugh (his new thing seems to be that he shits on peoples faces and their food and makes them eat it)</p><p>-aforementioned HOSTEL poacher auction of international sadists bidding on the corpse of the bird</p><p>-a shitty county fair (you absolutely have to see the terrible wood carving the bird creates to "honor" his new friends)</p><p>the whole crappy production shambles around with this menacing, psychotic mars attacks/killer klowns vibe, conjuring some of the sinister magick of classic woodys like south seas cannibal romp ALLEY TO BALI or the rando "necessary evil" freakout in RATION BORED ( <a href="https://pics.prcm.jp/fea9d77b1aafd/77291556/jpeg/77291556.jpeg" rel="nofollow">pics.prcm.jp/fea9d77b1aafd/77291556/jpeg/77291556.jpeg</a> ). its bad but if youve ever taken the time to watch GOOBY or some of the weirder moonbeams its kinda essential</p><p>also! somebody write mike weldon's psychotronic mag to snitch on woody's atrocity of an attempt at "surfin bird"!!!</p>


<br><b>916: The Lost Skeleton Of Cadavra</b>
<br><p>not all these jokes work and some of em (like a "for science!!" riff that was prob fresh in 01) have been regurged into irritation nowadays, but this is one of the only throwbacks that really gets the appeal of "bad" 50s bizarro dialogue and tone instead of just wobbly pie plates on strings. an early scene where the 2 leads stop to giggle at stock footage of squirrels over playful library music totally nails the genre as much as any parody/homage ive ever seen, and im incapable of disliking anything shot at bronson canyon</p>
<br><b>917: Despiser</b>
<br><p>holy shit from the first frame i knew id love this....and i did!!! the dialogue, the acting, the lighting, the whole gregorian_chant trance_mix.aiff score - 100% what i want a movie to be, not just the teknospektral beyond-the-minds-eye lavademon stuff, but all the regular unsolved mysteries ass domestic shit too, like an albert pyun omega code sequel shot in the pagan invasion castle, or pen &amp; pixel's BIBLEMAN: THE SEGACD GAME, dir. by tim ritter.... real scumbalina shit! this is one of those movies i know im gonna make everybody watch and hate but ill keep on doin it! seriously its on pr1me RIGHT NOW just watch it!!! despiser!!!!!!!!</p>


<br><b>918: Skeletons In The Closet 2018</b>
<br><p>some lame 80isms (the modern horror nerd rendition of "the 80s" has become its own unreal [bad &amp; dumb] reality to the point im not sure theyre even going for accuracy so it seems unfair to nitpick that comics in 1987 werent glossy &amp; tv stations didnt slap that one pink/blue neon grid on everything) but i'll watch anything with a tv horror host &amp; i love the idea of one thats a widow who killed her husband and watches movies sitting in a basement with his corpse... not a classic but you can do much, much worse</p>

<br><b>920: Noxious</b>
<br><p>this feels alexanderplatz-long but if you put it on while folding laundry occasionally youll see a cool toxic waste zombizoid or an old guy with pink macklemore/roger klotz hair so i dunno. theres also (what i think is) a non-joke bad guy named "gaylord johnson" and, like 2 hours in, a sub-margaritaville sunburnt beach song w/ synth steel drums where honestly if i wasnt almost done i woulda bailed. "zombies" is the worst genre cuz its just an excuse for lowkey racist/sociopathic survivalist crap (for guys who were the villains of every romero flick) or epic bacon win sir comedies called some shit like "brunch of the friggin dead" so i appreciate a movie thats neither of these, but- this shit is too damn long!! not without ok moments, but you can tell they fell in love with every second of dull footage shot &amp; couldnt bear to part with any of it! somebody get lloyd kaufman to edit this down to 73 minutes &amp; cameo as a drunk bum who sees a zombie, rubs his eyes, then throws away the bottle!!!! directed by a woman with multiple credits on dinesh d'souza's AMERICA: IMAGINE THE WORLD WITHOUT HER, of course</p>


<br><b>921: Immortal Kiss Queen Of The Night</b>
<br><p>mostly uneventful but omar noah's vain, enya-loving male model is one of the funniest characters in any david decoteau movie</p>
<br><b>922: Slice 2018</b>
<br><p>this was like a fox family big wolf on campus halloween special, which is prob (def) why i liked it. "is it the lord working in mysterious ways, or the devil working in obvious ones" is actually kinda deep</p>
<br><b>923: Jack O</b>
<br><p>even if youve never listened to the hilarious/infamous commentary its clear just from watching this shit the director is a humorless pain in the ass - he puts in enough stuff (halloween decorations, posthumous carradine cameos, linnea!!!) to keep it watchable but theres always the bizarre sensation of watching something that should not exist: a fred olen ray movie that takes itself seriously</p>
<br><b>924: Faces Of Schlock</b>
<br><p>like 70% too dumb but then george stover jumps up excited to dance along with a hokey pokey knockoff ("the okie dokie"???) on the radio and its good again. not the only movie i own where a guy wears a boondocks saints shirt but the only one i can imagine ever watching again</p>
<br><b>925: Vegas Vacation</b>
<br><p>this is amazing because it's just totally not funny, not even bad - i mean, its not GOOD - just absolutely not funny. nothing at all funny happens. im pretty sure im an ethan embry fan but hes just... there. everything is. contractual obligation movie, total blandness. air bud sequels have more personality. theres a decent gag about chevy trying to bribe a guy with pocket change that goes on like 3 beats too long. nobody knows why. i liked cousin eddie's fake monstervision trailer and i think theres a joke about the hills have eyes in there somewhere. his daughter has a barenaked ladies poster and theres a rooftop scene set to republica's "ready to go" ("on the rooftop shout it out") which feels wrong in one of these movies. i dont like a late 90s lampoon vacation. imagine if theyd played like.... juvenile. wendy the snapple lady is in this. theres so many classic comedies from 1997 - austin powers, romy &amp; michele, con air - its embarrassing how blah this is. i dont hate it but i couldnt finish it (which i ALWAYS do with movies i hate) because what even is the point. i dont care. happy halloween everybody!</p>

<br><p>cant remember what point in my life "played straighter than expected" became one of my #1 reasons for enjoying a movie but here we are. low, low expectations. this isnt nearly as funny as it thinks it is but it lands somewhere between astron6 and slither, way better &amp; weirder than my memory of the hacky trailer. i can def see the split in ratings from people who normally watch real hollywood movies slumming on hulu vs gross sov dorks overrating it against like, filthy mcnasty fart 5: filthiest mcnastiest, and i guess im in the 2nd category - this is pretty good, guys! when the (spoilers) reptilian humanoid shapeshifter conspiracy showed up the last of my resistance melted and the struggle was over: i loved wolf cop</p>

<br><b>933: Assassination Nation</b>
<br><p>i only saw this cuz there was argento music (the bird with the crystal plumage*) in the trailer and wow i gotta say it "really sums up 2018" told by a dumbass who corners you at a party &amp; never shuts the fuck up. i have a major soft spot for sleazy, ambitious failures so i guess the nicest thing i can say is i was never really bored, just annoyed &amp; exhausted at this stupid, stupid movie that wants you think it cares about teenage girls while relentlessly abusing &amp; fetishizing them, made by a condescending dork who thinks its social commentary to throw up shots of american flags in the background of empty violence, closing his eyes &amp; hoping the punch connects. its a loose collection of inflammatory concepts &amp; images with no point or conscience unifying them, a movie that insists its the only one brave enough to get REALLY REAL about society, packed with eyerollingly bogus hashtag-peppered dialogue ("nobody says hashtag" - daphne, daphne &amp; velma) and lazy hollywood nepotism hires (theres a fucking apatow kid in this). for any of the stuff i liked (a gnarly joel mchale kill, somebody saying susan sontag "never saw worldstarhiphop...") theres shit like this "feminist molotov" (groan) having a whole plot about a man in power FALSELY ACCUSED of sexual assault by an angry mob screaming "lock him up" - wow spicy!! def a great message to put out this week!! (or like... any week! shut the fuck up!!) its a phony, unfocused mess, and unlike the perky-quirky gilliamisms of SORRY TO BOTHER YOU im not feeling charitable for its messy heart being in the right place cuz its, despite what it thinks, not. i guess its progressive now we can see porn-y sexualized violence against black &amp; trans girls too (the boys even gender her correctly during their attempted lynching). what the fuck was that! for every detail this wannabe gen-z bret easton ellis gets right (a tumblr teen with the end of hackers on tv in the background) theres something like the intro !!TRIGGER WARNING!!!!!! montage, already corny in the trailer but 8000x worse when it opens the fucking movie. remember trigger warnings??? its all weirdly predictable for something trying to hard to be shocking. i knew exactly who was gonna be the mystery hacker &amp; when they asked why he did it i knew exactly what he was gonna say (guess) and groaned out loud in the theater at the hard cut to loud credits knowing this dude thinks he just BLEW MY MIND. its nonsensically edited, with constant theme-explaining narration. theres no stakes or connection to any character. it thinks 4chan is edgy. this is the kind of movie that just gets worse and worse, writhing &amp; slumping around to an incoherent, artlessly gory finale. its sure trying tho! the more i think about it the more i hate it, but i guess i dont begrudge some 10th grader who just got into movies cuz like, birdman, or la la land or whatever finding something love about this - maybe the 2060 equiv of vinegar syndrome or somethingweird video will reissue it on a strange-days v.r. holo-squid of late 2010s goofy "what if cellphones but too much" sexxtploitation and ill try it again but, nah</p>


<br><b>934: The House With A Clock In Its Walls</b>
<br><p>i dont really go to kids movies at the theater so whenever i see one its funny how much better they seem after trailers for shit like train yr dragon pt. 7 &amp; "smallfoot" &amp; benedict cumberbatch's weirdly ungrinchy dog-loving grinch "WITH NEW MUSIC FROM TYLER THE CREATOR!". this spooky amblin period piece - an eli roth period piece! - has a 50s monster kid sensibility &amp; charming dedication to outcasts &amp; weirdos, mostly without his usual cynicism (theres still dashes of roth's kulturkampf subtext nailed by some of my fav lbxders nick ("<a href="https://letterboxd.com/nicorice/film/the-house-with-a-clock-in-its-walls/" rel="nofollow">Roth has marked an interest in clashes of cultures...their obnoxiousness purely bred from exposure to the obnoxiousness that powers American culture on the whole</a>") and autumn (<a href="https://letterboxd.com/vexpoet/film/cabin-fever/" rel="nofollow">"The master of identity politics was fully formed even before the culture grew similarly obsessed"</a>) in stuff like a racially-integrated 50s school where the only problem with the drinking fountain is it doesnt have soda pop in it)(roth has them say "drinking fountain" like 4 times to nail the point home). full of halloweenish nostalgia to gawk at (check the marquee for MONSTERS CRASH THE PAJAMA PARTY) but taps into more human depth than just the (excellent) trick'r'treaty set design - i found myself ambushed by unexpected emotion with the idea of needing actual magick to cope with mourning &amp; tragedy, and maybe the most subversive thing about this movie is that roth endorses this faustian gambit as long as yr not a dick about it. unsurprisingly, cate nails this material, and jack black almost does too, playing a kinda jolly riff on jeffrey combs' doctor mordrid w/ a beardly wellesian heft - while its a mixed bag, his line read on "its a kimono!" won me over instantly - but you can tell roth has never directed kids before and doesnt yet have whatever it is that joe dante got out of corey feldman in gremlins. cate is a sly, purrped out witch who doesnt do enough magick but does raygun-blast drooling killer jack-o-lanterns with a violet lazerwand (just typed lazerwang) while jack black does his eyebrow thing in a fez and plays free jazz sax at 3am (i know its appropriative but i love this kinda midcentury exotic occultist shit like the beatnik witch african mask gallery in BELL, BOOK, AND CANDLE or most of CAST A DEADLY SPELL). theres some c.g. toony crap but less than i expected (almost all in the trailer) and for at least the first 2/3rds most of it is out of focus in the background kinda sneaky instead of shiny &amp; obvious. theres some real horror too - this was never gonna be as terrifyingly fucked as like, THE GATE, but even with roth i didnt expect a 2018 pg-movie to have a ten year old ritualistically spill his blood onto a pentagram to raise a corpse in the cemetery from friday the 13th pt vi, and i def did NOT go in knowing this was gonna be a killer puppet/doll movie AND evil plants movie!! so it gets too harry pottery and theres a kinda whatever ending but then i see parents imdb reviews and cant help but love it <a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4364055/" rel="nofollow">www.imdb.com/review/rw4364055/</a> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4354976/" rel="nofollow">www.imdb.com/review/rw4354976/</a></p>

<br><b>949: Boo 2 A Madea Halloween</b>
<br><p>i liked the first boo a lot but tyler perry is taking this "a madea halloween" shit a lil more serious this time. no, hes still leaving line flubs in the final cut but now he got a guy behind the camera who shot 2 parts of TALES OF HALLOWEEN (BAD SEED, FRIDAY THE 31st) and expanded his horror vocab to include a stringy-wig j-horror ringu girl, gasmasked slashers like the prowler or my bloody valentine, and a grim reaper straight outta SKELETON MAN. ok hes not naming characters "wes hooper" or putting fangorias on nightstands like an 80s movie (yet) but there's multiple candyman refs in the first 20 minutes!! this crosses the 1st boo's decoteau/olen ray-worthy plot of "sexy h.s. seniors at a spooky frat party" with a crystal lake slasher riff, doing more work to build halloween mood and even throw a lil bit of gore onscreen. of course theres still tyler perry's creepy family moralizing (i love a series dedicated to pranking the hell out of your stupid kids) and corny old timey sense of humor, with literal shitting-in-a-outhouse jokes and ab-rubbing fratboy with a catskills nyuk-nyuk voice. i dont remember grandpa? uncle? joe being the funniest in the other madea movies but his pimp talk had me chucklin in this. i guess you expect tyler perry to kill at "sassy old lady" types but im impressed he can also nail a dolemite/blowfly trick-smackin hustler. fuck eddie murphy, wheres madea in the rudy ray moore bio??? ok this also has a whoomp there it is dance sequence AND rae sremmurd live on stage in halloween costumes performing "black beatles" at the site of a mass murder and ends in a police station where we see on a poster the proudly anti-cop madea is wanted for "assassination" and "bringing a deadly weapon onto white house grounds" so....check it out</p>

<br><p>once again my love for ripoff horror icons gets me a mostly bad, transcendently stupid movie. the Hellinger (raspy bootleg pinhead) takes a black n decker drill to the dome pulls it out says a mind is a terrible thing to waste and sucks on it. i havent seen any of em but i bet this is better than all the actual new hellraisers they make now. no tears, its a waste of good suffering</p>
<br><b>954: Anunnaki</b>
<br><p>the guy narrating this says "two corinthians" like donald trump</p>
<br><b>955: Alien Paranormal Bigfoot Ufos And The Men In Black</b>
<br><p>dunno if this was a tv special or what but its a real throwback to when this kinda stuff would have actual creepy reenactments with a legit production budget &amp; local actors from car commercials instead of just putting the requiem for a dream music over a tucked-in-tshirt guy who carries a whole gallon jug of water around everywhere googling "monsanto + rothschilds?". im an extradimensional squatch theory believer so i appreciated the focus on that even while spending too much time on boring cave ghosts and saying bigfoot smells like "rotten cucumber". weirdos: this is the good stuff!</p>
<br><b>956: Sometimes They Come Back</b>
<br><p>the car too?????</p>
<br><b>957: The Barn</b>
<br><p>this looks cool but has that kinda bad acting thats not fun just irritating and takes way too long to get going but gets good once the guts start to spill, even if its a lot like demons rook, a way better movie. the retro gimmick is lame and doesnt hide that its not actually old enough to be charming. i will admit it had a barn.</p>

<br><p>ive been working 900 hour shifts 8 days a week at 2 pizza places &amp; all last week turned the tvs on the patio from espn/foxsports to ancient aliens &amp; syfy monster movies and im sure this one is 100% stupid as shit with the sound on paying attention but for how it made me feel glancing up bussin dirty tables its 5 stars</p>

<br><b>964: Fright Club</b>
<br><p>the first rule of fright club is dont watch fright club</p><p>lol nah this is actually okay... a dopey 3-act s.o.v. anthology sorted by race &amp; general mills cereal monster (latin/werewolf, black/vampires, asian/frankenstein) that occasionally looks more pro/slick than youd expect (cool masks) but still opens with dropshadowed papyrus font credits over somebody's bad coffeeshop devil paintings and a flaming geocities gif title card. the werewolf bit was prob my fav (its a riff on little red riding hood, as is legally required by all low-budget horror anthologies) but the dracula segment has a kid describing his music to his mom as "gothic meets hiphop..... i call it GOTH-HOP" so that was pretty good too</p>


<br><b>965: Space Amoeba</b>
<br><p>wait a minute... thats a guy in a costume</p>
<br><b>966: Skeleton Man</b>
<br><p>??what the hell is everyone talking about this movie is fucking awesome! skeleton man (a skeleton in a black cloak with a sword who rides a big red horse thru c.g. wormholes) brutally fucks up like 10 special forces dudes in the first 15 minutes!! ok michael rooker seems bored and theres a lame cali state park jungle and they couldnt get walkies so all the army guys are barking into tiny motorola flip phones but - let me make this clear - every couple of minutes the skeleton kills someone!!! this should be on the dvd: A SKELETON KILLS SOMEONE EVERY 5 MINUTES. and theyre all one-on-one stalk'n'slash splatter kills, not the generic smokebomb battles that make most military horror boring. he even scalps a guy!! im not one of those "just turn your brain off and enjoy" people but i'll make an exception for a predator ripoff with the grim reaper &amp; even after the ran-outta-money ending i am NOT afraid to admit i had a bone-afied great time watching 2004's skeleton man (from the director* of DRIVE ANGRY)(*2nd unit)</p>


<br><b>967: Night Howl</b>
<br><p>i thought this was pretty good! likeable characters in a weird story played mostly straight. a guy describes the werewolf to his therapist who asks if it had "resting bitch face". the lead is a chubby guy who shows a lot of skin, if youre into that. multiple people vaping. recommended.</p>

<br><b>971: Bloodmarsh Krackoon</b>
<br><p>this movie has some pacing problems</p>
<br><b>972: Deadtime Tales</b>
<br><p>hate to say it but.... this is good! also not a real movie, just 3 w.bush/flashmob-era danny draven joints (DEATHBED, HELL ASYLUM and DARK WALKER) awkwardly edited together which luckily turns out to be pretty entertaining when cut down to 35-40 minutes of g0re and pink gel lighting. edits range from confusing to almost fulciesque (dont get too excited) and theres some great satanic robes, halloween vibes, a joann-fabrics burlap swamp thing and joe estevez screaming ITS REALITY TEEVEE!! if they shot a cackling puppet host wraparound for this itd be 4 stars no lie</p>
<br><b>973: Sorry To Bother You</b>
<br><p>not as radical as i hoped (i love boots &amp; the coup) or reactionary as i feared (annapurna did ZERO DARK THIRTY, david cross + patton oswalt hangout w/white supremacists). sets up a zillion great ideas and pays off maybe 5 of em. feels like a 90s kitchen-sink cult-comedy like FREAKED or STAY TUNED right down to the goofy wayans gags (my fav) and super-dated gameshow/mtv cribs parodies. every onscreen performance ranges from great to incredible - lakeith and tessa and steve yeun and danny glover all kill and i wanted a non-surrealist regular-ass work drama about them just living life. i really, really hope this helps convince people to fight back &amp; unionize, but they never really set up how or why theyre striking, which makes it feel arbitrary and unrealistic to people in non-unionized regions like uhhh the entire southeast. i work 2 shitty part-time pizza place jobs and nobody F- or BOH would consider "not showing up" for better hours or conditions, even though theyre hungry for tools like that! people working crappy jobs dont give a fuck about gawker-fodder tech billionaire hijinks or some corny adbusters billboard vandalism but all the white-collar media "unions" founded the last few years by gentrifier lifestyle journos (wow vice writers have a union.... cool) eat this shit up. i hate to say it but you can tell boots riley has spent more time in that world (&amp; the modern art world) than working a shitty wage job since the clinton administration (who still sells encyclopedias?). theres zero mention of the app/sharing uber/instacart nightmare economy that anybody dead broke is actually stuck at in 2018 - he still thinks you put on a suit and go to the office every day. but that gallery stuff hits - the revelation that tessa uses her white voice for rich patrons just like you would in telemarketing is one of the most interesting ideas, until he forgets it immediately to move onto whatevers next. shes amazing but every scene of her throwing down radical politics gets offset by boots filming yet another horny underwear butt-shot (only 2 women with speaking roles in this and theyre both thirsty for the main dude). after discovering [huge, horrifying 3rd act spoiler] she has to waste an entire scene - her last real scene - reassuring our hero that she wont makeout with another guy again (with some more butt-shots). stop doing this shit!!!! and i loved [huge, horrifying 3rd act spoiler], and the sick-joke bipartisan acceptance of it. but political movies can really capture feeling broke and helpless, and this only sometimes punctures the cute indie-pomo quirk to do that. lakeith is so great he almost sells it (when black men in movies can only be beasts, badasses or buffoons then a generic comedy slacker/hipster bf is legit representation) but stuff like "my uncle's gonna lose his house" feels like its from a kids movie, his car is shitty in a cute way, everybody has $ for drinks at the bar and tessa does her weird nighttime sign-spinner job looking dope &amp; fashionable &amp; not collapsing dead from heatstroke like people who do irl. nobody is sick or desperate or raising kids alone like my mom or about to bottom out &amp; die. when he works hard using a racist trick he immediately has a ton of money! capitalism offers us consumers the choice of selling out &amp; getting rich, or keeping it real! workers gotta make the right choice! i know its ABOUT the sellout but its so uncomplicated and its a choice the movie can sneer at because its made by a character who can literally live without it. all the #occupy-ish protesting looks downright fun - pigs are whompin em but nobody dies or gets disabled or has to choose between striking or taking care of their kids &amp; theres never that feeling of being on the edge of oblivion, its all a game, corporate promotions and embarrassing "worryfree" jobs and the violent, tacky gameshow (when your leftist polemic gets comparisons to "idiocracy," run) are all framed as individual options we can reject &amp; feel good about - you either selfishly decide to sellout for a new car or do some ironist banksy "culture-jamming" towards people who do. in the real world people take life-destroying jobs for reasons more serious than being embarrassed their hipster art-garage isnt a luxury condo. individual consumerism &amp; "keeping up with the joneses" are not the problem. imagine a movie about somebody uncool &amp; poor who HAS to do degrading shit to survive, not accepting the big corporate promotion just because they feel directionless or underachieving or whatever. i dont wanna come off artless soviet-realist but i wish this was more instructive, like a panthers community outreach or one of those bikepunk squatter zines on how to dumpster dive &amp; resell office supplies from yr temp job. what the fuck are we supposed to do??? maybe ditch a few herpes jokes and have 15 minutes of tessa &amp; steven yuen addressing the audience on how to organize a strike and dare theaters not to show it. i know its a parody but the refusal to name names annoyed the shit outta me! people should walk out of this knowing who to hate without needing a decoder ring. nevermind how nobody under 40 remembers "a coke and a smile" - why "cola" and not coke? even UNSANE shamed kaiser permanente by name! UNSANE!</p><p>but what the fuck do i know????? boots riley has been a communist for longer than ive been alive. hes faced shit ive never had to deal with. in 2012 i was knocking doors for (ugh) democrats while he wrote this movie. in interviews i agree 100% with everything he says! its (prob) not his fault this slots right into trendy millennial dem-soc/commie branding (check reviews mentioning "late capitalism" so they dont have to say "capitalism"). maybe my expectations were too high but i kept wanting the feel of listening to his music without all the weirdo dave eggers quirky hollywood cameo bullshit creeping in. i guess it says something about rap vs film how this feels so much crazier in style &amp; more conventional in message while the coup sounded like regular funky oakland rap while pitching real subversive message shit. its crazy to not love this huge mess of a movie with working class heroes and a mistah fab cameo and refs to GREMLINS 2, YOUR HIGHNESS and THE UNDERTAKER &amp; HIS PALS &amp; i really wanna rate this higher for intent &amp; ambition &amp; theres enough relatable down-to-earth stuff and loopy shit to recommend &amp; even enjoy it but.....yeah. also r.i.p. pam the funkstress! and check this out i guess</p>


<br><b>974: Love And A 45</b>
<br><p>this has a rep of one of the better tarantino wannabes but its actually one of the worst. rory cochrane, looking like a soundcloud rapper ( <a href="https://i.imgur.com/D9XhUQs.jpg" rel="nofollow">i.imgur.com/D9XhUQs.jpg</a> ) chases 2 lovebird roadtrip killers to the bitter, boring end and even jeffrey combs x peter fonda (playing his character from THE TRIP, kinda) cant make up for the endless parade of quippy, quirky lowlifes &amp; florid two-bit creeps pontificating on spirituality &amp; pop culture. so derivative it starts to feel like a wayans movie parody (noted when jeff combs started howling &amp; bleeding out in the back of a car but confirmed by a 3rd act mexican standoff) with some of the dumbest, laziest observations about "america" and "celebrity" done so halfassed they feel like contractual obligations. fake deep 90s guys sure were shook about AMERICAS MOST WANTED huh??? whoaa man what if somebody like, WANTED to be a criminal.... to get on tv???? lol this movie blows</p>


<br><b>975: Star Slammer</b>
<br><p>ahhh i fuckin loved this</p><p>all the cheers and wolf whistles to indicate a crowd of thousands just off camera and multiple characters with a fucked-up eye and music ripping off "she blinded me with science" &amp; the raiders theme and a soupy sales/gabbo "that oughta hold the little bastards" joke and john carradine's floating spacehologram head and a volcel MRA badguy who has henchmen bullwhip him to suppress his urges and! and!! the lil wrinkly cafeteria alien ! ! !</p><p>a real fred olen ray masterpiece.............. of crap!! which is good!!!</p>
<br><b>976: The Washingtonians</b>
<br><p>such a weird, great idea, executed like an episode of r.l. stine's the haunting hour. perfect 4th of july watch if it was actually any good - "america" is a blood-drenched lie established on murder &amp; the real "founding fathers" killed &amp; tortured real kids, for real (they just werent white). bungles the society/they live approach - imagine this by hooper or craven or larry cohen! - for groaner comedy &amp; a weird pizzagate/spirit cooking vibe that almost works but shrugs into flat disappointment like every other masters of horror, not least because the 00s canadian cable tv aesthetic never has any weight or sense of place. also richard band did the music and hes ripping off his own scores to the alchemist and - no lie - demonic toys!</p>

<br><b>984: Ultra Warrior</b>
<br><p>almost everything cool is a clip from another movie but luckily theyre some of the best movies of all time so its okay. people (DACK RAMBO) stand around describing footage from roger corman movies then cut to that footage while roger plays the president of the galaxy like hes lloyd kaufman or some shit. all the self-plagiarizing concorde/new horizons cut'n'paste from this era is like a trashy scammer take on craig baldwin's critically respected b-movie cut-ups and i love it</p>
<br><b>985: Megaforce</b>
<br><p>fuck the megaforce</p>
<br><b>986: Superfly</b>
<br><p>nowhere near the o.g. superfly but a solid crime/action flick with touches of real exploitation greatness &amp; at least a dozen good performances and scenes. no surprise this is basically a feature-length rap video, trading the documentary realism of 1972 for some splattery gore, doofy rapper cameos, and shots where bottles pop symmetrically on either side of the screen. sure, the last thing superfly needed was explanatory narration over digital b-roll, but maybe it did need a scene where a mexican cartel boss threatens to throw youngblood priest out a private jet by asking if he reads tabloids "...like a HOUSEWIFE?!!?!?!!!" or a (confusingly filmed but i think all real) car chase thru grant park that ends with the fiery explosion of a rebel-flagged confederate monument??? and if the 2 curtis drops remind you that future is no curtis (and these songs are no pluto/ds2) i still jump up hearing pusherman over a moving-bricks montage. you can see director x (usher's YEAH, nore's BANNED FROM TV, hotline bling/god's plan, etc) struggling to make dead-on-the-page shot/reverse-shot convos interesting by staging them at a karate dojo or the firing range (where priest &amp; eddie resolve their tension by just shooting more) but theres enough generic action &amp; unclear blocking (michael k williams doesnt notice a maybach parked across an empty street? where are they??) to confirm youre not watching hype williams. x did work on BELLY (as "visual consultant") so he prob created shit like the clean all-white-everything look he flaunts here (loved the ivory automatics) and brings enough contrast &amp; excess to keep your attention. it even ends on his trademark "vertical letterbox" shot!!</p><p>tons of atlanta shit - oakland cemetery, holyfield's mansion, opera on crescent (as some kinda eyes-wide-shut mask club), "take her to grady, its the best trauma center in the city," a joke about creflo dollar's church, the barbershop next to midtown wash on 6th drenched red in a shootout, big boi as the ass-grabbing cokehead mayor, a cameo from ZAYTOVEN... they even got the clermont in an establishing shot. but then theres shit that reminds you somebody not from here made this, like how a movie soundtracked by future opens with an old freeway verse (why?), or a line where a gambler boasts his money is "longer than peachtree street" which is some shit new york ad agencies put on billboards when they google "things in ATL" for a smirnoff campaign</p><p>trevor jackson is good, not great as priest (cool opening scene) - he gets the soft-spoken omniscient intellectual vibe but never feels at all like an atlanta dude and him &amp; his yung joc perm cant touch ron o'neal's style (hes got the grandma coats but too many turtleneck &amp; chains, like hes nino brown or that old pic of the rock) and hes in a weird poly relationship and fakes out dealers by catfishing them as a teenage girl (???) so its a land of contrasts (i "LIKED" when he beat a racist cop half to death with his own baton / i "DONT LIKE" when he says "who the fuck is morris day?"). eddie is jason mitchell, eazy in straight outta compton, and hes so good they changed his character up to keep him around the movie more - i cant get enough of this guy &amp; look forward to watching him in other shit. i was into kaalan walker's jittery boosiesque performance in the first act &amp; got ready for him to steal the show but then the movie kinda forgets about him and introduces like 20 more characters and sorta wastes his potential - hes great tho. i also loved jennifer morrison as a dirty cop (one of the few women who isnt treated like a video hoe by the director of HOT IN HERRE) - shes mouthy, funny, bitter, crooked as a barrel of snakes, and reminded me of, no bullshit, jennifer jason leigh, the highest compliment i got. theres a ton of great lil supporting roles and cameos that do exactly what a movie like this should - keep it interesting &amp; moving while the boring plot rolls out. idk if its the distance of 45 years but the real superfly felt like real people, like they set up the camera in a room and left it running, here it feels like actors &amp; rappers doing a video, portraying a part, cheesing &amp; playing to the crowd, but both work for me! and with a crowd id be there opening nite for a SUPERFLY T.N.T. with 21 savage as dr sonko or whatever</p>

<br><b>989: Wrong Turn 3 Left For Dead</b>
<br><p>how/why do people keep going out to these woods when theres like 100 empty cars so the 3 guys (just 2 this time) have killed like a thousand people at this point</p><p>that said im glad i watched these in order cuz the gradual debasement of what started out as a kinda serious movie had me laffin out loud at the first 5 minutes here - quick n dumb gore gags messily out the way without the cynical, hollow tone of pt 2, like what every other "fun slasher" is trying (usually failing) to do. after that, the inbred hillbilly cannibal family (again, just 2 guys) dont really show up a lot but theres a gang of thickneck tuffguy felons all yelling macho threats at each other which gets a little boring but at least its not the people from the last one - its even kinda predator-y if you squint. the inbred cannibal hillbillies look even more like theyre wearing cheapo grandpa halloween masks this time, which i liked. occasionally the grandpa mask guy does a mortal kombat fatality on one of the escaped cons but mostly its just tuff guys bickering and some of the kills have zero inbred cannibal hillbillies involved which was disappointing. theres more shiny cgi blood and the rear projection at the end looks like an snl sketch (dont make a "wrong turn" toonces the driving cat!!) and i really wanna know how these feral hicks are building advanced cube/cube 2: hypercube level mechanical cut/slide traps?? it was better when it was just big sticks and barb wire not this saw 4 shit. also this time they dont even make a wrong turn the route is on purpose!! cmon, wrong turn 3!!!</p>

<br><b>992: Wrong Turn 2 Dead End</b>
<br><p>one reason i liked the first one was nobody is an obnoxious asshole but they fixed that for the sequel. also the "wrong turn" is paved now what is this shit. this has some ok gore but zero suspense and i hated the reality tv stuff it makes no sense (howd they set all the traps without running into the hillbilly cannibals???) and i looked it up and the director is friends with adam green of course cuz this felt like one of those shitty hatchet horror con movies (uhh i mean "FLICKS"!! shit yeah!!) you can tell he thinks hes a real grindhouse badass too, sexist &amp; predictable. some of the bad taste gags work and theres an i n c r e d i b l e final scene (toxic waste baby) even if its halfway ripping off cabin fever. then again theres one of the most annoying characters ive ever seen in literally any movie. listen, i LOVE daytime outdoor leafy summer campout slashers so its xxxtra disappointing this ends in the worst of all horror locations, the dark abandoned warehouse/factory. fuck!! also the title is stupid</p>


<br><b>993: Wrong Turn</b>
<br><p>this has some great shit in it but all the stuff in the tree was kinda stupid. i love the squealin and cacklin cannibals! the main dude's oxford shirt &amp; khakis look perfect after all the nasty shit until the very end. also this feels weirdly like a jurassic park?? but yeah some great shit</p>

<br><p>ok first of all this has the greatest studio logo i have ever seen no joke. its technically watchable but laughably cheap for this kinda plot, weirdly similar to zone troopers (sci fi nazis) or trancers (low budget timetravel) or pup master 3 (low budget sci fi nazis). the guy on the poster is just as irritating as he looks, but not the pauly shore way youd expect - hes going for a bland, featureless take on jerry lewis or eddie deezen (imagine eddie in this role!!) but comes off more like the dad from alf. this kinda shit can only be pulled off by robert picardo or i guess literally anybody else. he makes a bunch of dumb faces when nazis show up in his house to do bad fish-out-of-water comedy and nobody thought itd be problematic to have fucking nazis breakdancing in tie-dye shirts to a third reich war march remixed over the "think"/"it takes two" break</p><p>so yeah this is really bad but its blessed with one of the greatest scene changes in movie history - suburban nebbish dad whining to his dumb kids in their boring kitchen CUT TO huge brownshirted torso with a swastika armband, pan up to reveal shaggy-haired mustachioed ROBERT Z'DAR.... who then heils hitler!!! ! i wanna edit that clip into every movie i ever get bored watching to wake me up again. i need a button on the remote that just plays that when i press it. anyway z'dar is barely in the rest of the movie and instead its stuff that sucks. they call the nazi time travel portal a "white hole" (like... racially????) and its a refrigerator which i remember they nixed for back to the future because kids would imitate it and die but i guess if theyre imitating nazis its ok lol. anyway, dont watch this!</p>

<br><p>this has more workouts than killer workout and more sixpacks than 10 quiktrips but its suprisingly political for a movie where monique parent (as "some mysterious MILF") stabs a guy in the dick thru his tightie-whities. id hail it as radical queer anti-colonialist agitprop if it was actually, yknow, any good</p>
<br><b>1005: Tremors A Cold Day In Hell</b>
<br><p>this is one of those movies where everybody talks like "heads up hombres, we got a dumpster fire of a shit sandwich on steroids here, so let's just say i forgot the mustard" &amp; its fucking embarrassing. a sorta remake of the first one (like all of these) but not even as good as the last one (which seemed more fun to me??) and the screenplay is just one of many problems - its set in the arctic but theres no snow or ice &amp; everybody's wearing tanktops cuz they filmed in south africa just like last time (spot all the afrikaaner van/du/der names in the credits like romanians in a 90s full moon) and its shot with some weird gopro wide-angle cam that looks like cheap shit and while i love michael gross (&amp; hes the best thing in this) all the sexist groaner dick/balls masculinity one-upping movie-nerd-screenwriter's-idea-of-how-regular-dudes-talk dialogue &amp; folksy gun nut tough guy one-liners make burt gummer sound like judge judy ("dont spit on my cupcake and tell me its frosting") AND worst of all he doesnt even wear the atlanta hawks cap &amp; instead rocks a fuckin cubs hat the whole movie!!!!!!!!! why???</p><p>ok, the good stuff: anything with a monster hunter conspiracist prepper worried about DARPA reminds me of late nite coast-to-coast AM callers (r.i.p. art) and theres some interesting-to-me stuff about burt having hallucinatory visions from an internal graboid parasite that doesnt really pay off. they do blow up a bunch of em into splattery orange goop which is still as exciting to me as when i was a kid and theres a big prop mouth graboid that i loved - when was the last time one of these had a big slimy rubber monster???? but yeah all of thats not enough to make up for a scene passing the tremors torch to fucking jamie kennedy</p>


<br><b>1006: Phantoms</b>

<br><b>1007: Killing Spree</b>
<br><p>this is really well-made for s.o.v. and has an 80s end credits rap (!) and i guess (??) its satire (???) but i just couldnt get into watching an OCD jealous guy with a freakfolk beard killing people cuz he thinks his wife is cheating on him</p>
<br><b>1008: 1313 Bigfoot Island</b>
<br><p>this goes 8 and a half minutes walking around old-growth pacific northwest forest before the first line of dialogue so its basically an art-house movie </p><p>it isnt good of course but after trying to watch 3 or 4 shitty new horror flix last night i had to give in to david decoteau again. his movies are always so cheerful &amp; fun even when theyre about gross/dumb stuff - this is early 1313 so hes still figuring out the formula and while this might be the most "cinematic" of the series the boys are kinda substandard to some of the later hunks. i liked the pov squatch cam ogling thats obv just david behind the lens and the twist ending had me rubbin my abs in shock. all the best bigfoot movies are the ones where nothing happens so the lazy 1313 style actually works here instead of being disappointing when its supposed to be about witches or ufos. i love this guy!!</p>


<br><b>1009: All Eyez On Me</b>
<br><p>yeah this almost captures something about pac in TWO AND A HALF HOURS (!!) of corny lines &amp; asides to the camera but its still kinda bad &amp; mostly pointless. starting off pro-BPP / afeni over a soundtrack of short dog &amp; e-40 won me over quick but the only trick they got to tell how pac was a intelligent/sensitive thug is him quoting shakespeare over &amp; over &amp; over (scene on the balcony where fake-pac somberly intones "...indeed, the fault is in our stars..." to a dumbfounded biggie had me bout to throw up) like ok dude was drama club/art-school but the weird respectability politics/eurocentrism/ dumb-ppl's-idea-of-smart-ppl shit killed my vibe (they couldnt mix it up and have him write e=mc2 on a blackboard or something??) meanwhile every shitty/violent/disrespectable thing gets depicted as pac standing off to the side shaking his head while suge makes a dude eat a diaper or whatever, the opposite of straight outta compton where eazy was the only vital/interesting one cuz dre &amp; cube are still alive to make sure they arent shown doing anything that could jeopardize the profits of apple™'s beats™ by dre™ or "are we there yet?

<br><p>A Sorting Hat?!?*</p><p>if youre curious how davey d can pull off mockbustering hansel + gretel: witch-hunters on a rapid heart budget the answer is, it all takes place in 2013, in a house. ok theres a community college-slash-wizard school with 2 emoji-teed stuntman's kids (BOOBOO and FIEVEL???) throwing cartoon fireballs, planet raptor's vanessa angel in a red cloak with a screwston devil voice and, for like five minutes, a (this is a description ive had to use too many times) visibly drunk eric roberts, who they cut away from in the middle of his lines cuz hes slurring so much they have to ADR the last 3 words of every take. set in "salem, massachusetts" (clearly los angeles, even the stock footage - the classroom has a california flag!!) and kind of a suspiria ripoff so i had an ok time</p>

<br><b>1030: Veronika Voss</b>
<br><p>i love any story about a washed-up actor or celebrity who desperately believe theyre still famous and one thats (i think) shittin on anticommunists is even better! obv this looks b&amp;w amazing but the music is on point too, using corny 50s honkytonk radio for nightmarish horror like a bridge between kenneth anger &amp; david lynch or something (i promise this is the only time i'll ever write a sentence like that). way better than "sunset boulevard with no jokes" should be, unsettling &amp; emotionally p cold but so engrossing that after 10 minutes i stopped thinking about the girl who told a dude her name was veronika with a k and when she looked at his phone he put in "keronica"</p>

<br><b>1037: Death Wish 2018</b>
<br><p>"that sounds like a good scream" "that sounded like a very good scream"</p><p>all of roth's movies make explicit the stuff thats unspoken in normal movies, like de palma* crankin up (&amp; to) the shit implied by old hollywood (pre-frenzy) hitchcock, except brian depalma never used splitscreen to put up worldstar memes of his main character cold-blooded murdering a car thief ("when somebody spoils game of thrones"). its disgusting to imagine the world's worst assholes swallowing this as a news report from trump's chiraq (stand-in for oprah &amp; obama &amp; everything black they hate) but all of roth's politics &amp; signifiers fly scattershot to avoid revealing his real target - studio notes aside, death wish is a mess because hes not indulging, hes tearing apart. how can you see the scene where bruce comes home from real-man gun-nut texas to his daughter being read milton friedman in a coma (later, c.s. lewis - the twin planks of conservatism, fiscal/religio-cultural) not as a joke? or the gun shop's dumbass tittys'n'glocks commercial ("tactical furniture!! suprise 'em!!") that inspires him?? do you need a chorus of sway &amp; mancow debating every righteous, delicious kill? (you get that too) dotted with gracenotes of unexpected depth (riding the train, saving a cop-killer) mixed in with the corniest splatstick gags and stupid shit like bruce depressedly eating huge slices of chicago deepdish in his basement while the hard-ass cop (verhoeven fave dean norris, great in this) is reduced to snacking on organic gluten free blueberry health bars. hey, we're makin a movie about masculinity over here! bald, homer simpsonesque bruno stepping out like a conquerer in heroic slow-mo to "love sosa", trying to control a world more complicated than bronson's ever was (im still convinced d'onofrio was in on it), changing the meaning of a street-vigilante movie into something phony &amp; impossible to know. bruce thinks hes knows - he imagines inked-up hispanic gangbangers killing his wife (killed while making a mexican dessert from an appropriative bilingual cookbook) but at the end of the game discovers 3 streetwise white dudes kinda like him. bronson never even tried to find the perps - unlike bruce his hunt was a proxy, a case that could never be closed, which makes this movie's finger-gun stinger ending way sadder &amp; scarier. eli roth's last movie was about a good husband &amp; father, a family man with a mask of gentility so thin that all it took was one catalytic incident to unveil a screaming core of misogyny - if youre only good when the world is good, youre not good. a few years before that roth made another one kinda like death wish, about a regular guy who finds the inner strength to take up a gun &amp; defend what's his - it was "nation's pride", the nazi propaganda film credited movie-within-a-movie to joseph goebbels (who roth-in-the-movie kills with a gun, just to make sure nobody thinks hes serious). im not saying roth thinks paul kersey is a nazi, but hes definitely playing with the idea.</p><p>*another depalmaean flouish i loved - scenes brought home by donaggio/vampire's kiss horror stings, where lines that landed clunky in the trailer - "i'm not gonna kill you, jack is" - actually work when punctuated with cheesy only-a-movie dun-DUN-DUNN!s (the rest of the soundtrack struggles between chicago drill &amp; lame ass classic rock, just to hammer the metaphor)</p>


<br><b>1038: The Strangers Prey At Night</b>
<br><p>its already march &amp; i hadnt gone to see any new movies &amp; i love going to the movies! to see a shitty slasher!! </p><p>this was boring and the projection was too blurry. christina hendricks has an enamel pin of a green alien head on her jacket. the strangers (?) play 80s pop ballads (air supply, total eclipse of the heart) when they kill people (why?). couples in my theater who paid to see this opening night were straight up having unrelated conversations instead of paying attention. if the strangers are just sickos on a goof why the terminator persistence? why do nothing crazy or interesting?? its competently made but doing a setup this basic without any personality is like watching a backyard s.o.v. friends-in-the-woods slasher done too professional to be weird or funny. i read an interview with the guy who directed this &amp; he said he was inspired by john carpenter (halloween) BUT NOT THE MOVIES YOURE THINKING OF (the fog and christine) and yup theres fog and cars kill people while playing nostalgia songs but with none of the rhythm or intent that makes carpenter work. im not saying it needs more incident or backstory - most movies have too much - but you gotta have something. also they rip off the texas chainsaw ending literally 100 percent. it was ok.</p>

<br><p>this isnt as good as "wwe films enlists the jock from christine to direct wesley snipes and anne heche in a cyberpunk haunted prison event horizon/13 ghosts-style a.i. conspiracy horror thriller" should be, but its still one of my faves from last year. mostly feels like a 1995 pm entertainment release, with a muddled, cynical take on the military youd expect from stuff intended to be redboxed by unemployed vets &amp; air force reserve guys in north dakota. sometimes approaches the tick-tock rhythm of carpenter (i thought of prince of darkness a few times) and while its nowhere near the same level it def feels like it takes place in the same bleak dtv action world of hyams universal soldier sequels. also- check out those 1337 end credits !</p>

<br><b>1062: The Circle 2017</b>
<br><p>one bad Apple</p><p>i thought this was an interesting trailer back in march or whenever (im a dumbass) but it all adds up to one big n0th1ng. i knew id hate it, but its a techno cyber-thriller about social media being shitty so of course i had to watch it.. first of all, nobody is any good in this! emma watson &amp; tom hanks* are just whatever, john boyega does what he can with a baffling non-character and patton oswalt &amp; the boy from boyhood are unbearable (you really gotta suck to have me rooting against a luddite). its also - get a load of this - filmed &amp; shot like tv and - i hope you're sitting down - literally nothing happens. theres a few scenes that capture something real or new abt tech &amp; use watson's dull blandness to creepy effect, like her TED speechifying against privacy or live-streaming an ugly modern sculpture on the fake google campus ("made by an artist who's frequently in trouble in his own country....i want to thank all of you who sent frowns to the government there... we have sent over 180 million frowns from the u.s. alone!!") - this reads like satire, but then the irl conspiracy-fear of this movie is that fbook/google could steal votes in a congressional election??? they give up completely on the idea "social media corrupting all aspects of human life" and it becomes"what if a bad c.e.o. bribed a senator" which couldve been made in 1952 about fuckin IBM or exxon or whatever. of course in the end we just gotta swap out the bad billionaires with nice ones and we're all good. i guess the idea is to sheepdog YA-lit teens who suspect that capitalism spying on them might be wrong and imprint"...unless we get a nice person to run it!" but im surprised they felt the need in the first place. if the planet doesnt die out in the next 50 years and humanity actually continues being sustainably shitty we might look back on this crap like we do old countercultureish dystopias that missed every point &amp; werent actually smart. this is not a good movie. this is a bad movie with bad ideas. </p><p><a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/tom-hanks-is-a-cia-asset-a-potential-timeline/" rel="nofollow">tom hanks is a CIA asset</a> watch:</p><p>this movie implies the u.s. gov has zero interest in "the circle"s pervasive, omniscient survelliance and could only interact with or be influenced by all-knowing panopticon tech if they had salaried lobbyists literally buying off a senator. the idea that evil-fbook would have to shape things from outside at the whims of a villainous CEO is a fiction that intel agencies love to promote (remember the original "fake news!") it also propagandizes ballot voting in amerikkka as a sacred patriotic duty that makes a real difference and can only by infringed upon by hypothetical techno-dystopia and the worst thing that google could do to you with it is bribe a senator and tilt the scales on some congressional votes. its another limited hangout but im surprised they used hanks' geniality to play the kind of smirking, affable creep he really is ("the us government has lost its credibility so it's borrowing some of mine"). i dont know which handler signed off on that but its... interesting. </p><p>[also both actors who play emma watson's tech-skeptic parents, glenne headly &amp; bill paxton, died within months of release, but im sure hanks knows nothing about that]</p>

<br><p>legit shocked i heard good things about this boring, empty, ugly (not in the good way) blue lives matter bullshit. i love "problematic" vigilante/revenge flicks but this drags on way too long (75 minutes before "cell block 99" gets mentioned in a movie that is, no bullshit,135 minutes long) its shot &amp; color-corrected like one of those superbowl luxury car ads set to an eminem song and has a dumb groaner script based around epic boondock saints one-liners delivered in a fake* blue collar redneck drawl by the giuliani-republican millionaire wedding crasher who played fred claus in "fred claus". this is the strained cialis nuttface of every flag-respecting youtube comment on the bruce willis death wish trailer, tv-level action directed indifferently by a guy in a bootleg MAGA hat written in a freeware "grindhouse" font. i dont think its funny to joke that certain fascist shit is worse for being boring than being fascist but we're a long way from dirty harry, first blood &amp; john milius here, trapped in the phony playset of a guy with a MOLON LABE sticker pasted on the laptop he uses to lay badass chuck norris facts on trump pics to "trigger" his ex-wife. this condescending fake exploitation crap is an insult to the rural redbox/dvd-rental market i grew up in where wwe-produced mockbusters starring wrestlers as shellshocked iraq vets can rise to real complexity &amp; compassion instead of shallow, pandering cynicism. this movie sucks. half star for a few populist touches that worked (i like any movie where someone gets fired) &amp; some gore that shows up in the last 10 minutes, one whole star for udo kier, but come the fuck on</p><p>*Vaughn's mother, Sharon Eileen (born in Brantford, Ontario, Canada),[2] is a stockbroker and real estate agent who was once ranked as one of the United States' top money managers by Bloomberg Wealth Manager magazine.</p>

<br><p>oh no somebody told charles band about gel lights &amp; hip neon color grading but he doesnt know how to do it!!! i rewatched pt.10 "axis rising" before this (btw charles u a lazy hack for not doing the phantasm oblIVion thing making this aXIs termination) and while this has the same budget of 5-6 characters / 3-4 cheapo sets that they tried to convince me was an entire axis rising the diff is 1) the writing &amp; performing got a lot better and 2) they [spoilers] immediately kill off the boring captain america ripoff couple from the last 2 axes &amp; replace em with 2a) a moody haitian voodoo priestess 2b) a thickneck army guy who looks like the face from the bottom of the wolfenstein 3d screen 2c) a soviet theologian played by george appleby, the young fondacaro-esque dwarf actor from ravenwolf towers the awesomely terrible full moon soap opera i secretly love [he brings along that show's ugly sitcom-grade wall panels] and 2d) dwarf theologian's shy telekinetic daughter, all fighting sadistic lovecraftian nazi creeps led by the most evil/interesting bad guy of any of these since richard lynch in 3. just like the last half-dozen this is barely about the puppets (most of it they dont do anything besides put in a lot of reaction shots like the ghoulies in ghoulies 1) but i dug returning to the psychic/occult themes of the first movie &amp; would, i cant believe im about to say this, watch this story even without the puppets. its a whirlwind tour of bad accents where germans sound russian and russians sound cockney but they manage to sell the idea of ancient, unknowable cosmic evil better than a lotta recent attempts (for the first time in forever the scenes where they obv ran out of money actually make the offscreen horrors bloom in yr mind) and i'll throw on an extra half star for some quality ms.leech kills and [spoilers?] a woman wearing a freddy glove topped with glowing green reeanimator syringes. 3 1/2 stars!</p>

<br><b>1112: Chloe</b>
<br><p>lol this movie establishes liam neeson's maybe-cheating husband as so cultured hes some kinda OPERA PROFESSOR lecturing an amphitheater of doe-eyed students about don giovanni and all i could think about was his awkward first date w/ judy davis in "husbands &amp; wives" when she's like "don giovanni.... fucking men....they should've cut his fucking dick off" (im sure woodsy allen thinks this makes her sound unreasonable/crazy instead of the only reasonable/uncrazy person in any of his movies) nobody in this is that adversarial, theyre all isolated &amp; aloof &amp; the o.p.p. plot is mostly a jumping off point to explore moore &amp; seyfried's lonely, desperate characters in a backdrop of cronenberg torontonian coldness (neeson [spoilers] fucks/tries to fuck/maybe doesnt fuck seyfried even tho hes..... "taken" but has no perspective or agency and the movei is mostly about whats going on inside julianne moore's head as best as a movie about women directed by a man can be) - this isnt full american giallo and is only barely an erotic thriller but its well-made art/trash and a throwback to the kinda smart-ish r-rated movies that married couples would go see together before it was all spidermans &amp; singing, smirking animals</p>

<br><b>1114: Nightscream</b>
<br><p>when you think of classic 90s television, who can forget the mystery that captivated america, the unsolved murder of a beautiful, popular teenager named laura in a small pacific northwestern town full of quirky locals that makes suspects of her moody greaser boyfriend &amp; creepy dad while the truth is obscured by haunting dreams, doubles &amp; disappearances - thats right, im talking about the 1997 nbc tv movie NIGHTSCREAM !</p><p>i found this on vhs and only realized it was a tv drama &amp; not shitty post-scream slasher when it kept fading to black over musical stings like a star trek voyager but then i actually kinda got into it, the way you can enjoy an ugly 1988 italian mad max or alien that has no idea why the original is any good. twin peaks without style or surreality is an interesting experiment, especially when it doubles as a relic/time capsule of an era when candace cameron could be caught wearing orange pleather mod squad jackets over electric lime wide-collar shirts. actually teri garr is good and cameron is appealing enough but, get ready to have your mind blown, not a great actress, esp. playing multiple personalities w/ different hilarious voices (and when her and casper v.d. get going.........hoo boy). she has a diary with some really cool drawings of bloody faces and they veryyy hesitantly dip into some of the abuse elements of t.p. (but make the dad her stepfather because theyre not gonna go that far also his name is RAY like RAY WISE??? cmon!!). this has some of my fav cheapo twists, like a character seeing a photo of someone they know by name but its NOT that person, or just introducing an entirely new character in the last 15 minutes cuz youve run out of twists (it does the evil land developer red herring 10 yrs before hot fuzz) and i really enjoyed watching actors i usually see in wholesome christian b-movies playing slightly edgier than usual </p><p>so, after zoning out to this movie's drab lifetimeish charms the most important/hilarious thing came right at the end when the movie goes for a big emotional moment with the most blatant ripoff of chris "fire walk with me" isaak's wicked game ive ever heard, the incredible "HAUNTED BY TWO LOVES" by someone so embarassed they refused to even have their name in the credits. i unironically love this song/lawsuit-waiting-to-happen so much and it sums up everything fun about the kind of stupid ripoffs i enjoy so i ripped the audio &amp; uploaded it so yall can hear it too <a href="https://clyp.it/yt2djrro" rel="nofollow">clyp.it/yt2djrro</a></p>

"oh yeah tom.... absolutely... if you only see one movie this year, it should be frankenhooker." (scattered audience laughs) OR!~ maybe he saw the marquee like months earlier and it was a dumb catchphrase/in-joke for him and his comedy buds to joke about this movie called frankenhooker and he threw it into an interview like you do with those obsessive 6-week in-jokes where you cant remember a year later why it was so funny OR!!! maybe he actually saw frankenhooker and legit enjoyed how funny &amp; creative it was and gave it a sincere recommendation??? (this one seems least likely but ive seen henenlotter suggest it? idk) anyway ive found that in addition to spongebob tumblr teens &amp; 8-paragraph nolan guys this site has some old cult movie nerds who were doing shit like writing for film threat or videohound in 1990 (in addition to weirdos like me who buy old psychotronic mags to look at the ads) so if anybody has any context (or weird theories!!) for bill murray's often-repeated but never-explained frankenhooker recommendation plz let me know</p>

<br><p>i remember seeing this on a plane when i was like 19 and hating it (i prob wanted to watch like, blade 2) but i watched it again for my #52 and kinda loved it </p><p>this opens with red carpet b-roll of fashion models while jack nicholson voiceovers his cornball views on women set to the tune of - absolutely not joking here - crazytown's "butterfly" so i was 110% sold already (how the fuck did i forget he plays a jerry heller gangsta rap mogul who debates diane keaton on "the poetry of the streets" &amp; she gets the final smug word "oh, rap is poetry? well, how many words can you rhyme with bitch?" lol i bet nancy meyers said that at a party &amp; put it in her screenplay)</p><p>i actually love how nance writes nicholson as a lame-ass "cool guy" for her uptight/nerdy heroine keaton, like how corny male writers invent a "cool girl" love interest for their dorky braffian stand-ins, and how that cool guy is deconstructed once he's recovering &amp; frail - the characters go from sitcom-level broad to something more interesting as the movie goes on and you almost stop hating them. it actually worked on me in a way not a lot of romantic comedies (besides like, boomerang or the apartment) do, and got a couple of legit awww moments despite myself (never thought id be charmed by 2 shrill elderly zillionaires finally enjoying 8 hours sleep together) its mostly just these jerks talking and arguing in rooms without a big supporting cast (no prob when yr 3 back-ups are frances mcdormand + amanda peet + keanu) or interesting locations but i was weirdly invested/engaged thru the whole thing...... why do i like these people????</p><p>honestly was gonna do 3 1/2 starz but im throwing on a extra 1/2 for a hilarious wayans/zucker-worthy gag of a blood pressure cuff recklessly thrown over a rafter in the heat of passion</p><p>also; is the scene of keaton begging jack to cut off her turtleneck before they fuck a metaphor for circumcision ????? sound off in the comments</p>

<br><b>1140: Cries In The Night</b>
<br><p>this might as well come in a box labeled generic 70s horror movie but i still kinda dug it. the cast of goofy cops, horny teens and dumb guys in overalls kinda feels like its gonna be a rubber monster creature feature but no its a [spoilers] genderswapped psycho riff. the only thing less surprising than the killer reveal - and props to the editor for cutting right at the twist so all the boring psycho explanation rolls under the end credits - was finding out dude who made this directed like 30 episodes of goosebumps. real lazy sunday afternoon stuff.</p>

<br><b>1143: Goth 2003</b>
<br><p>bad, but never boring. a goth named goth (phoebe dollar, good in this &amp; lots of other crap like this) gothnaps 2 yung soft-goths in a driverless gothvan for a wild night of s.o.v. depravity. not as smart or edgy as it thinks it is (duh) but its well-made and listening to goth (the character) rant about being goth (the lifestyle) was never not fun</p>
<br><b>1144: Decadent Evil</b>

<br><p>embarrassing softcore sex comedy/fantasy [NOT horror] lazily camcordered in &amp; around an ugly vegas hotel bar jazzed up w/ surf guitar and video toaster fx. this is dumb as hell but considering most of its 00s s.o.v. peers are nihilistic murder crap its just goofy/likable enough for me to not say some shit like "if you watch this youll BEWITCHING you didnt"</p>
<br><b>1147: A Bucket Of Blood</b>
<br><p>lol sam arkoff invented the hell yeah i love ______ acrostic joke format</p><p>Essential to the success of A.I.P. was Samuel Z. Arkoff's tried-and-true ARKOFF formula for low-budget movies. His ideals for a successful movie included:</p><p>Action (exciting, entertaining drama)<br />Revolution (novel or controversial themes and ideas)<br />Killing (a modicum of violence)<br />Oratory (notable dialogue and speeches)<br />Fantasy (acted-out fantasies common to the audience)<br />Fornication (sex appeal, for young adults)</p>

<br><p>(david decoteau voice) LOVE IT</p>
<br><b>1155: Childs Play 3</b>
<br><p>underrated by fans &amp; audiences alike, 'child's play 3: look who's stalking' invites us to 'look' at a devastating multi-layered attack on western values, rebuking the institutional barbarism of american military culture - where nonconforming kids are bullied into imperialist killers - advancing its broad-range capitalist satire into the corporate boardroom ("what are children, after all, but consumer trainees?") to make real the inherent violence of a 1%er high-rise penthouse (in atlanta!), deconstructing the fragile, queerphobic masculinity &amp; transmisogyny of chucky violently rejecting lipstick &amp; his panic-murder of the julio-claudian army barber who hints at performing a delilah on the doll's samsonesque red mane, and unraveling chucky's "get out"-style fetishization of transferring into an appropriated black body ("chucky's gonna be a bro!") lol just kidding this is garbage made by idiots</p>

<br><b>1161: My Uncle The Alien</b>
<br><p>this says its rated pg for peril and "mild language" which is a standard 'what the hell' but i hoped was gonna be somebody going "this alien looks like shit!"</p><p>starts a lil rough but the combo of bavaesque lighting/surprisingly dark+weird tone/side role for wynorski-olen ray regular jay richardson (BEVERLY HILLS VAMP, HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS) + an extended chase thru the now-demolished movieland wax museum (including the star trek bridge, a killer "robot geek" and superman's ice cave) almost makes up for uncle the alien's incredibly shitty/reactionary class consciousness ☭</p>
<br><b>1162: Assault Of The Killer Bimbos</b>
<br><p>this is dumb fun AND the most feminist movie in film herstory &amp; theres a joke that takes place in all of 30 seconds but i think about all the time: the killer bimbos have been framed for the murder of sleazy gogo club manager "shifty joe" and the murderer tosses the gun in their hands &amp; runs out the backdoor of the club so they run out after him &amp; hit the road in their convertible -- cut to them driving over rear projection of neon l.a. streets:</p><p>"why don't we just call the police and tell them what happened...theyll believe us!"</p><p>"cops never listen to girls like us...trust me, i know.."</p><p>"well if we can find the guy who did it &amp; turn him in, then theyd believe us, right???"</p><p>"lulu, you're dreaming!! that guy's probably in another country by now!!"</p>


<br><b>1163: Dead Body Man</b>
<br><p>about as good as a movie named after an insane clown posse single could be, this is more of that pointless idiotic shit from ryan cavalline i love. a few early scenes actually work, especially one in a church self-help group that pitches to a level of surreal discomfort i associate with like, arrabal or bunuel, but its mostly just an irritating dork in a freddy sweater torturing prostitutes until the movie gets bored &amp; decides to become a lazy basket case ripoff </p><p>its....interesting how many of these zero budget sicko torture flicks are made by what i assume are atheist guys "satirizing" religious belief as a scapegoat to act out their own misogynist fantasies - a buncha nerds who dont believe in god smirking thru patchy beards &amp; "ironically" thumping bibles, playacting as evangelical prudes who rant about cleansing all the c*nt whores and jezebels....like i said its....... interesting</p><p>still, unlike 95% of this sorta junk i gotta admit ryan cavalline always combines a zippy, entertaining pace with real dedication to constant, hilarious technical fuckups (editing, lighting, sound) that make his shit some of the most fun-to-watch bad s.o.v. ive seen. also sets the record for cinematic murders set to zydeco</p><p>("YOUR DEAD" alert: the dead body man goes to apply for a job at the "UNEMPOYMENT" office)</p>

<br><b>1179: Jurassic School</b>
<br><p>a 12 yr old genetically engineers a real living dinosaur to upstage his lab partner's toy robot t.rex that poops dunkin donuts munchkins. he keeps it in his bedroom w/ lotsa ferns to eat but his tween sister finds it &amp; paints nail polish on its claws &amp; they have a big selfie montage. the dinosaur never gets anywhere near as big as the poster but it does run around a school a little bit. this reminded me of charlie band's PREHYSTERIA! series and i liked how even tho the main kid is a boy theres a equal number of smart girls who get to have fun too + seriously it warms my heart theres a brand new 2017 movie that 1000s of ppl will watch on netflixx where an actual non-cartoon dinosaur is portrayed by a hand puppet. also theres only 2 imdb reviews for this and one of em is somebody whose avi is the dog from family guy saying "BITCH PLEASE I'M BRIAN" so check em out</p><p>who built that plastic dinosaur doll, comes from 18th!<br/>4/10<br/>Author: Enkidu<br/>4 April 2017<br/>kids acting was fine, parents were OK,Doctor and teacher were god, dinosaur animation was acceptable, but when camera gets close and they use the plastic version, god that's horrible horrible! even those kids could do better job. why did the producer ruin everything by being so careless about the dinosaur its self. the voice of dinosaur, was that a man trying to make baby crying voice?!</p><p>Oh boy, was this film a romp.<br/>10/10<br/>Author: Pachooey from The Moon<br/>4 April 2017<br/>First of all, the title had me hooked before i even picked up the case at blockbuster! The first half of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, the characters struggles felt so real! i mean, high school, right!?! Its tough especially when the teachers bundle you with that homework and assignments. BUT. The trouble increases by soooo much when a DINOSAUR comes to school, he got straight a's though, my kids loved this movie!!!!</p>

I BELONG HERE!!!) i finally saw my most anticipated of 2017 and..........its good! this made me think how much "movie made for women" gets coded "erotic thriller" so to not scare off dudes - theres real emotional insight &amp; craft mixed into this nancy myers giallo bloodbath &amp; dont trust anybody who tells you otherwise. heigl's brutal glares, villainous vaping &amp; white wizard robe poker-wielding in the nutso finale should immediately become new drag show standards.

<br><b>1204: Los Angeles Plays Itself</b>
<br><p><a href="https://image.ibb.co/jJ6iY5/khaled.jpg" rel="nofollow">image.ibb.co/jJ6iY5/khaled.jpg</a></p><p>this was cool + they should do one for atlanta but give the narrator guy a 64oz big q of mtn dew or something first</p>
<br><b>1205: The Great Alligator</b>
<br><p>a real ladies man tells a bunch of girls to come swim in a murky river with him because "even if you shit yourself nobody can tell in here!!!"</p>
<br><b>1206: Mr Majestyk</b>
<br><p>wow this movie fucking rules!!!!</p><p>charles bronson plays melon farmer vince majestyk (what) and the whole plot revolves around his incredible drive to harvest a crop of melons. great example of a character having a goal they care about and thats enough to make the audience care - you dont have to already be invested in melon-farming to get caught up in it. i loved bronson in this! hes calmer hijacking a prison bus than i am getting up to get a glass of water but then somebody will mention the melons and he'll do an exaggerated 'that's what im TALKIN ABOUT' hand gesture. he just wants to pick those melons! al lettieri is the main badguy and hes scary/funny at the same time &amp; kinda reminded me of javier bardem. this is a pretty serious movie but almost feels like a treevenge-style 70s grindhouse parody of a straw dogs or death wish type flick where the whole revenge plot is set in motion by ugly, brutal violence against melons. i loved every minute of it.</p>


<br><b>1207: Evil Bong 666</b>
<br><p>i thought it was pretty good. evil bong calls gingerdead man "ginger little dick man". what do you want</p>
<br><b>1208: The Silencer 1992</b>
<br><p>dont let the boring title &amp; generic afterschool special poster fool you (it needs a <a href="https://letterboxd.com/pd187/list/that-kinda-poster/" rel="nofollow">that kinda poster</a>) cuz this is some good sh!t, a soft-radical action satire like if amy holden jones ghostwrote a cyberjunk la femme nikita sidescroller. soon as i heard the title sung* as a fake bond theme over ugly sega genesis grafixx and the credit for morton downey jr popped up next to a pixelated biker hitwoman knew id love this movie</p><p>amy goldstein wrote &amp; directed this ...story? of lady assassin angelica (lynette walden) strapped w/ a gold-and-silver-plated gatty who gets her kill_list.txt from an arcade VR game which matrixes all her targets strengths + weaknesses ("Fatal Flaw: Biker Boys"). she rescues girls from the gutter, hits the shooting range in a drag king mustache, and picks up a dorky muscle himbo as her softcore plaything (watching dumb surrender cinema crap its interesting how many softcore genre flixx are made by women &amp; gay men**?? also im gonna boycott these movies til theyre back 2 constantly talking about safe sex)</p><p>there's brook susan parker &amp; 16bit puppetmaster chris mulkey, both trying out for future woman-made teknolust thrillers (she's cecile in STRANGE DAYS, hes in rachel talalay's dope GHOST IN THE MACHINE), and subspecies' count radu as a sleazy, vampiric film director probably based on real life </p><p>this is the kinda movie that can plod for 20 artless minutes and then give you a scene of violence in the sunlit prism of bathhouse reflections, pools of water shimmering on rows of columns. it can be dumb as a post then unfold layers of unexpected meaning, like when she plugs the actor playing a priest in a sacrilegious film shoot, a movie in a movie in a movie. there's daytime warehouse noir in the steamy slomo of cheap-to-lens los angeles alleyways, tender midday hookups in apartments with balcony herb gardens, art-directed cigar smoke as the mood. there's smart-dumb references to ms.45 and taxi driver, and the real evils of jealous exes and rapist cops. there's multiple visits to a store that sells nothing but leather pants and jackets</p><p>im gonna say unless u normally watch doofy gunk like this for fun dont expect anything deep or special but im an actual idiot and i liked The Silencer (1992) </p><p>*by rough trade's carole pope!!!!!</p><p>**mandatory david decoteau reference</p>

<br><p>i was hyped to watch an early 70s manson movie and the beach scene that opens this is incredible so i was kinda disappointed when it settled into what seems like standard 70s vampire shit but theres a lot of background here so stay with me--</p><p>kerry thornley, founder of discordianism &amp; only person to write a book about lee harvey oswald before 1963, said a guy in new orleans named gary kirstein - later identified as watergate conspirator e.howard hunt - told him in the early 60s of the cia's goal of creating a "hippie hitler" to discredit the anti-war movement. he talks about it 30 minutes into this 1992 interview at atlanta's a cappella books <a href="https://youtu.be/gvBs3qE0-Ik?t=30m57s" rel="nofollow">youtu.be/gvBs3qE0-Ik?t=30m57s</a> *</p><p>e.howard hunt also wrote like a 100 spy novels but also (under a pseudonym) occult/satanic panic horror fiction about ritual murders, with titles like THE COVEN, THE SORCERERS &amp; DIABOLUS</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coven-Howard-Hunt-writing-David/dp/B000JJTYSG" rel="nofollow">www.amazon.com/Coven-Howard-Hunt-writing-David/dp/B000JJTYSG</a></p><p>there's a scene in deathmaster prominently featuring the november 1970 issue of ramparts magazine** in the background - the issue featuring frank browning's article "they shoot hippies, don't they?" (w/ intro by s.d.s. founder tom hayden, whistleblower of cia-funded hippie assets like gloria steinem*** ) </p><p>"they shoot hippies, don't they" reports berkeley police deploying cultural &amp; psychological ops to destabilize the community, without ever mentioning former berkeley police nuisance charles manson. the tate-labianca murders were just one month after reagan sent in the national guard to murder antiwar protesters at the peoples park at UC berkeley. here's a detail i found on people's park: </p><p>"Berkeley city police officers were discovered to be parking several blocks away from the Annex park, removing their badges and donning grotesque Halloween-type masks (including pig faces) to attack citizens they found in the park annex."[21]" </p><p>tate's blood was used to write "PIG" on the wall of the scene of her murder</p><p>journalist mae brussell, whose research on the kennedy assassination allowed her to recognize names &amp; cia connections of the watergate burglars when the press was still treating it like a random break-in, connected the cia's OPERATION CHAOS to manson here</p><p><a href="http://www.maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Operation%20Chaos.html" rel="nofollow">www.maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Operation%20Chaos.html</a></p><p>one of the named targets of operation chaos? ramparts magazine</p><p>in deathmaster, mansonesque cult leader khorda is played by robert quarry (whose original COUNT YORGA copied sharon tate's onscreen death in FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS and sequel THE RETURN OF COUNT YORGA replicated her actual death in one of the manson home invasions, done in the film by his female vampire "family"). he produced the film deathmaster independently and wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym "r.l. grove" (bohemian?). it was completed in 1970 and buried for 2 years by AIP while the title was used to promote unrelated quarry pictures ("the return of the deathmaster")</p><p>theres a scene where a hippie's iron cross with a 13 in the middle repels count khorda - just random 70s nazi biker shit, or something else?</p><p>sharon tate's father, colonel paul tate, served in military intelligence from 1947 (working on operation gladio in italy) til his daughter's murder in 1969. he says after her death he says he grew his sideburns out &amp; went "undercover" as a hippie to catch her killers. </p><p>when arrested manson was thrown in the cell next to sirhan sirhan. who did rfk have dinner with the night before he was killed? roman polanski &amp; sharon tate. who hosted? john frankenheimer (whose manchurian candidate predicted jfk's assassination just like polanski &amp; tate's films predicted manson).

<br><b>1219: Spy Hard</b>
<br><p>i love em but u can def see the origin of friedberg n seltzers' reliance on parodying movies totally unrelated to the genre (why a sister act riff where leslie nielsen throws jars of yellow piss in a nuns face???) which almost is almost worth it for the home alone parody where burglars beat the shit out of fake macauley culkin </p><p>eddie deezen, marcia gay harden, a rejected t.rex from carnosaur and andy griffith saying the words "mortal kombat" - this movie is a-ok</p>
<br><b>1220: Dynamite Joe</b>
<br><p>for a pasketti western this is a lil poky &amp; has too many scenes in fancy ballrooms but that cant take away the fact that its about a guy who solves every problem by ! ! ! ! BLOWING IT UP WITH DYNAMITE ! ! ! ! ! when the bad guys buried him in a cave &amp; drank to his impending death i was like <a href="https://frinkiac.com/img/S03E14/574275.jpg" rel="nofollow">frinkiac.com/img/S03E14/574275.jpg</a></p>
<br><b>1221: The Swamp Of The Ravens</b>
<br><p>this has a swamp (in ecuador) and ravens (actually buzzards) and its one of those movies where not much happens &amp; nobody reacts when it does. postcard establishing shots fade into 70s interiors of people talking about whatever and something kinda gross or weird happens every 20 minutes. i liked it.</p>
<br><b>1222: Space Thing</b>
<br><p>hersch-g.lewisque trekkie nudie cutie w lotsa dull desert locations &amp; ugly pie plate spaceships. theres a drawing of a bugeyed antenna alien but no such alien appears - its ok.</p>
<br><b>1223: Death From Beyond</b>
<br><p>nearly unwatchable s.o.v. bore with 2 things going for it 1) some cool cd-rom egyptian grafixx 2) the dvd sez 80 minutes but credits rolled after 35 and the remaining half was outtakes!! this is the only movie ever made where the blooper reel is longer than the actual movie</p>

<br><p>my name is taquito / i live on the island / my plane got shot and i crashed into the sand</p>

<br><p>i can never be a Real Cinephile cuz i like john landis's stupid beverly hills cop sequel more than the tony scott one</p>
<br><b>1226: Robotrix</b>
<br><p>"i take that as an insult, both to me and the robots i create!"</p><p>"is that true? will technology ever stop??"</p><p>this starts out as dorky frankenhookery fun, gets real dumb like a bionic hong kong porkys for about half an hour, then gets fun &amp; good again for the wildass finale with a robot wielding a slumber party massacre powerdrill!!! just hold tight cuz when it veers into mechahardbodies: fart 3 cuz theres enough gore + cyberstyle throughout to take it at least halfway seriousish</p><p>also i looked this up online after watching it and apparently my (dubbed) version cuts out a bunch of graphic rapes played for laffs or boners so................dont watch that version. the cut i found on infamous darkweb hacker rokuchannel am*z0n pr1m3, had lotsa womandroid nudity but zero sexx scenes and all the stuff w/ robophiliac cops peeping a brothel was comedy reaction shots edited together 4 yuks not 4 h0rny creeps. having not seen the uncut movie (or most CATIII in general?) i say if yr gonna do this i recommend the almost-wholesome USA Up All Night edited-for-t.v. experience i had</p>


<br><b>1227: Maniac Cop 3 Badge Of Silence</b>
<br><p>what the fuck is a badge of silence</p>
<br><b>1228: Little Ghost</b>
<br><p>this is about a 12 yr old named kevin but narrated by him as an adult so basically its an episode of the wonder years where kevin has a crush on a dead girl filmed in the subspecies castle with a clearly drunk sally kirkland so im down for it</p>
<br><b>1229: Zontar The Thing From Venus</b>
<br><p>this opens w/a big onscreen "ZONE 6" but not one single scene was in east atlanta</p>
<br><b>1230: Office Killer</b>
<br><p>i know cindy sherman has seen a jazillion movies and still didnt expect carol kane reenacting scenes from crazy fat ethel</p>
<br><b>1231: Robocroc</b>
<br><p>ok the robocroc has terminator POV vision that displays shit like PREY DETECTED or TARGET ACQUIRED so like.....can the crocodile read?</p>
<br><b>1232: Trancers 6 Life After Deth</b>
<br><p>this is cheap as hell even for a trancers sequel and essentially feels like a fan film with a new actress doing a movie-length tim thomerson impression so of course i liked it. she grits her teeth &amp; answers "good to see you" with "it'll be good to see you......ON A SLAB." !!!! classic jo deth right there</p><p>they edit old thomerson clips from the other movies as dialogue over a desktop PC monitor in a lab ("JACK, WE GOTTA SEND YOU DOWN THE LINE INTO A HIPPIE VEGAN FEMINIST IS THAT OK??" CLIP OF JACK DETH IN TRANCERS 3: "YES." <a href="https://frinkiac.com/img/S07E02/1035283.jpg" rel="nofollow">frinkiac.com/img/S07E02/1035283.jpg</a> ) to set up this bizarro im-my-own-grandpa plot of him freaky-friday inhabiting his own daughter so if you enjoyed the girl mcnulty gags in t1 &amp; 2 (and who doesnt!) this is a whole movie riffing on that and its pretty fun</p><p>i also liked how they brought back the trancers cult idea from t2 to do some manson style california valley murders after being hypmotized by a glowing meteorite. its clear they have absolutely no money (i think "jo deth"s apartment is her real apartment) but it actually looks more or less like a real movie which is more than you can say for most post-2000s charlie bando product (even the 1st one has boom mics in the frame) </p><p>i cant imagine this would make anybody's top 5 fav trancers list but i enjoyed it maybe more than 4 or 5 and if youre anything like me and enjoy going around talking like jack deth all the time then for about 80 minutes you wont feel alone in the world </p><p>also theres a glowing green liquid alien skull guy so</p>


<br><b>1233: Bloodbath In Psycho Town</b>
<br><p>this movie was ayte (theres an occult bookstore in it) but 5 stars for the imdb comment where the guy who did makeup complains the director spent his entire $200 fx budget eating "horrible food like fried squid and crap" at a local spanish restaurant 😂</p>

<br><p>this movie is a work of art</p>
<br><b>1235: The Godsend</b>
<br><p>The Goditsboringwhenwillthisend</p>
<br><b>1236: The Perfect Host</b>
<br><p>ive wanted to see this forever &amp; the first 65ish minutes surpassed all my camp expectations.. before limping across the finish line to receive the gold medal for Most Unnecessary Endings. you know how youll read the history of some masterpiece and learn how the core idea emerged from a much more complex original plot, but as they were making the film they realized what really worked was this one thing ("when we saw their chemistry we knew the real story was the character's romance, not the funding of an international plot to kidnap zebra embryos from a zoo for cloned animals before it goes bankrupt being sabotaged by the CEO's evil nephew......") and pruned away all the other bullshit to the point you cant imagine the movie any other way?? this isnt one of those movies</p>


<br><b>1237: Essex Spacebin</b>
<br><p>"every film is a foreign film" and pretending i understood where this troma-distro'd backyard scifi caper is coming from'd be like when u see a dork from cruffton-on-brumbleshire representing h.e. holmes atl cuz they liked the dey know video. pd187 funfact i spent almost year in the uk and still feel like i need a vh1 popup video of findlay's head telling me what all this shit means but i think i liked it</p>
<br><b>1238: Fox And His Friends</b>
<br><p>i was hyped when this started at a circus sideshow but after the first 5 minutes theres no more of that and the remaining 2 hrs is just rich dudes buying antiques and discussing the terms of a small business loan (no joke). the actors are good and it looks great but once the plot starts all the details unfold pretty much exactly how youd expect. i did like the end where the kids steal his disco stu jacket</p>
<br><b>1239: Before I Die</b>
<br><p>3-segment s.o.v. horror anthology::</p><p>1. hilarious goof about a chubby goth who hangs around malls picking up nerdy dudes to seduce cuz shes [SPOILER] an alien spider!! this is literally perfect 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟</p><p>2. slowww honeymoon ghoststory w/ great title pun ("last resort") - surprisingly atmospheric, well-made &amp; engaging but not as fun as the last one. dawn murphy directs &amp; stars #52bywomen 🌟🌟🌟🌟</p><p>3. boring, incredibly dumb sex/murder scene mostly filmed in a crappy bedroom with a FRAMED POSTER OF THE CHEVY CHASE MOVIE "FUNNY FARM" 🌟</p><p>theres also a wraparound where some dorky hack is writing all these stories on his big 90s desktop computer (no stars)</p>
<br><b>1240: Footprints 1975</b>
<br><p>wow this has been hiding for years on a shitty mill creek 50-pack next to gunk like HORROR HIGH and i knew it had a good rep but nothing prepared me for actually watching it</p>

<br><b>1243: Virtual Encounters 2</b>
<br><p>you: surrendering to the art of cinema<br />me: watching Surrender Cinema</p><p>extra half star for dude VRing as a girl and him being into it ("oh my god... i always wondered what these would feel like...") without making any shitty jokes, i guess</p>

<br><p>this is so dumb they literally took shit from it verbatim to use as jokes in austin powers. great music tho!</p>
<br><b>1245: Assassin</b>

<br><b>1246: Skyscraper</b>
<br><p>sure its a Big K™-brand die hard but the stunts are incredible, anna nicole smith is an angel [-l.f.hysterique], and it knows what die hard knows, that every character no matter how small should have some dumb memorable quirk...this movie is really fun!!</p>
<br><b>1247: She Was So Pretty</b>
<br><p>this tilts towards shitty torture porn a lil more more than i dig, rendered in artschooly hanekesque long takes &amp; the hard-to-pin-down timelessness of- well, potrykus if im generous, "it folllows" if im not. more than ready to write it off after 5 minutes of bandcamp carpenterwave over fetishy serial killer stuff, but as it unfolded i actually found a lot to appreciate and think about - the distance between the silent creeper off the poster and the bullying loudmouth cop on his case, who seem dropped in from totally different movies, is resolved perfectly, in a way that really feels like a statement instead of an exercise. i liked this more &amp; more as it went on, and i'd recommend it.</p>


<br><b>1248: Mutant Species</b>
<br><p>a bunch of guys in spaceballs helmets fight the psycho from maniac cop 2 after he animorphs into puppy predator..... i loved it</p>
<br><b>1249: Killjoys Psycho Circus</b>
<br><p>in this latest installment of the aptly named "kill joy" series (after 5 of these i no longer enjoy movies or life) charlie hunnid-bandz misses his chance to capitalize on 2016's now-dated creepy clown trend but makes up for it by having most of the movie be about an abusive, irritating clown relationship straight off a harley quinn deviant-art some kid showed him on their phone filled in w/ story details from half-remembered late-nite watches of "seed of chucky" &amp; extenze man-boost informercials. its bad, folks.</p><p>......but ok once you watch evil bong 1 thru 7 and all the shit that exists to lower expectations for every crappy fullmoonvie u feel like yr gettin a treat when its like "wow, they filmed in TWO rooms??!! they have ads in the movie for products NOT sold by fullmoondirect.com??!"(its dildos)...killjoy goes to space....i dont even know...........</p>


<br><b>1250: Phobe The Xenophobic Experiments</b>

<br><b>1253: Trancers 4 Jack Of Swords</b>
<br><p>this opens w/ soft-focus shots of a hand as it draws a loving charcoal portrait of tim thomerson and ive never felt more represented by a movie in my life</p>
<br><b>1254: The Crate</b>
<br><p>this is barely a monster flick but its a must-see hilarious character drama + doofy slice-of-life and unlike 99% of SOV junk its almost entirely exterior shots of parks and streets in an actual city (new york) !! ! ! check yr shitty pendulum dvd packs cuz u might already own it</p>
<br><b>1255: Killjoy Goes To Hell</b>
<br><p>god i dont know.... i love the idea of a slasher sequel where the demons of hell put the killer on trial for all the potential victims who got away but this is, of course, annoying as fuck. a gregg allman lookalike satan plays juggalo, jury &amp; executioner and nails the shitty clown in court for not being evil enough, possibly inspired by charlie band's many lawsuits* for the exact opposite. continuing to whitewash the all-black cast of killjoy 1 theres now like 7 untalented white guys for every 1 untalented black actor and for some reason lots of screentime for killjoy's exes (??) </p><p>doing a stagey courtroom drama means theres actually enough going on in the dialogue-driven script to make it to 90 minutes instead of bloating out credits &amp; flashbacks to barely scrape 63 (not necessarily a good thing). theres some minor pleasures - the sitcom-y single set feels appropriate for once, esp a dumb CG hellevator - i actually laffed at intentional jokes, instead of croaking a mirthless death rattle at what's become of life - a mime fucks a witch &amp; sews a robot baby into his side, duane bradley style - there's a nutso gory ending, an unexpected ripoff of the victor montage from rules of attraction, and nobody tried to sell me any racist toys</p><p>also killjoy gives someone an atomic wedgie</p><p>this is the best killjoy movie i have seen !! i have seen them all !! !</p><p>*<a href="https://www.plainsite.org/profiles/full-moon-entertainment/" rel="nofollow">www.plainsite.org/profiles/full-moon-entertainment/</a></p>

<br><b>1259: Teen Sorcery</b>
<br><p>this 90s teen witch goof opens with a fish-eyed hype williams videodream serving up classic nightmare elements like</p><p>* evil alarm clocks<br/>* finding somebody bound &amp; gagged &amp; when u pull off the mask its you<br/>* a scary witch who morphs into a CGI black widow spider</p><p>but unfolds a lil slowly after that - i expected a less-cool "the craft" but started worrying how much less-cool when it sets up 4 highschoolers who wanna narc on a cool witch like a teen SNITCH instead of aspiring to be teen witches themselves. these girls fall for lines like "come to my house, i have a cool cd collection" eat popcorn CONSTANTLY from those red &amp; white striped lets-all-go-to-the-lobby buckets and pronounce SOREY like theyre submitting it for the approval of the midnight society (this is set in massachusetts, romania but peopled entirely with canadian child stars &amp; that sprinkling of inexplicable carpathians u meet in every 90s charlie band cheapie, dark-eyed teens dubbed like anime sidekicks &amp; science teachers who snarl like nosferatu)</p><p>the actual cool witch is head cheerleader/posh spice-lookalike "mercedes" who communes in the dunwich/transylvanian woods with a spider amulet carved in a tree that glows spectral green while she incants petty requests like changing her math test to a tuesday. this makes our not-yet-witches want some _teen sorcery_ to live delish as well so they consult a cool librarian (the only cast member over like, 20) who opens up her great-looking LIBRARY OF THE OCCULT basement (+1) to teach them witchy junk</p><p>things pick up after that but even when our lead goes full-blood vvitch shes still blue-eyed &amp; cornfed enough to make sabrina look like mater suspiriorum. she does host a dope costume party b-day on friday the 13th so i'll give some vvitch daps for that but dont expect any of fairuza balk's toothy cornered pitbull sneer. some of the witch stuff happens with bionic man sound fx ("ive got to stop fantasizing about lee majors.... oh, one more time") and the girls get swole up which which inspires the classic line "jesus, flo, you've got, like, schwarzenegger grip!" (for some reason the girls are all named oldtimey stuff like "franny" and "flo")</p><p>eventually the movie turns to fantasy medieval time travel (like every other moonbeam) as we warp back to the middle ages thru a mini wormhole (?) in a cheerleaders locker (???) to play frisbee (?????) and mercedes (SPOILERS) turns into a ps2 polygon dragon and (SPOILERS) ends up in an alternate universe where everybody's a revenge-of-the-nerds nerd except her (??????????? ????????? ?????)</p><p>all this and still not even close to being one of the weirdest moonbeam flix. recommended, to idiots, like me.</p>


<br><b>1260: Dark Angel The Ascent</b>
<br><p>boy i felt like HELL FROZE OVER when i found myself watching a 90s full moon w/ intelligent, likable characters, artful production design and a thoughtful, original take on morality &amp; theology,like a gothy "splash" or clive barker's disney princess flick. take the time to check this out, esp if yr name is aleph null [everybody else too]</p>
<br><b>1261: Yoga Hosers</b>
<br><p>surprised how much i didnt HATE this but yeah its bad. one thing i thought - you know on true crime shows how theyll have somebody do the reenactment of their close call or home invasion or whatever and since its the actual real person theyre a "bad actor" and seem phony even tho it really happened to them irl and obv didnt "act" fake when it happened?? i feel like these two kids are clearly pals &amp; seem funny &amp; charming irl but kevin "the big short" smith watched em goofin n cheesin &amp; decided to write a bunch of wack teen kevin smith dialogue so they could playact as "best friends" in his movie and it ends up feeling like watching the gas station guy on forensic files haltingly reenact what he said during a stickup</p>

<br><b>1264: Deep Impact</b>
<br><p>u know how everybody talks about titanic like its 100% melodrama romance but its actually a dope action movie??? this is kinda like that in reverse - if yr expecting all-action/disaster this has a lot more drama &amp; humanity but if yr expecting a real human drama idk... its the latte lib answer to armageddon where instead of lubbock texas the asteroid/comet is described as being "the size of manhattan" and our hero is intrepid msnbc reporter ice-tea leoni instead of OILMAN JOHN MCCLANE WHO THREATENS DUDES DATING HIS DAUGHTER LIKE ONE OF THOSE FACEBOOK DAD MEMES... lol theres even a guy from milquetoast fav the west wing hangin around in here. as much as i like movies about stupid shitty assholes i sometimes i enjoy stuff where nobody is stupid or mean for no reason, where they dont force character conflicts just to have something going on.... obv irl ppl are stupid and mean 24/7/366 and its hilarious/unreal the level of nobility &amp; honor that everybody in this faces THE END OF THE WORLD with but it kinda worked for me? some mild beefs but essentially everybody we see is smart and nice. oh yeah + i love how for each presidential address morgan freeman gets less &amp; less formal rolling up his sleeves and loosening his tie until the last one where hes just in a white polo shirt like......bye everybody! also this is the only vanessa redgrave movie to inspire the name of a busta rhymes album (THERES ONLY ONE YEAR LEFT!!!!!) unless theres some flipmode tribute to howard's end i dont know about. in conclusion, a good movie.</p>

<br><p>Those acquainted with Mr. Carson said he was a serious student, typically wearing a pocket protector and toting a reddish-brown briefcase. “He would go to bed at like 9 p.m. and get up at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. and put on a suit, a tie and a jacket and a button-down shirt and study in the early morning,” said Thomas Noonan, an actor and Mr. Carson’s roommate their sophomore year.</p>
<br><b>1278: The Secret Kingdom</b>
<br><p>one of the weirdest moonbeam flicks (which is saying something) directed by david schmoeller with shades of his own TOURIST TRAP and NETHERWORLD (they even let him shoot in new orleans!) </p><p>one of my fav things about schmoeller is you can tell hes got a real ear for how to use music in film, typically one of the biggest weaknesses in full moon flicks - netherworld has actual blues &amp; rock artists used in an almost lynchian way, and somehow when making puppet master he got richard band to write &amp; perform a classic horror score. the dreamlike opening of this has a kid wandering the alleys of new orleans with street performers fading in &amp; out of earshot, ending at the home of his younger brother &amp; older sister, parents out of town, establishing the 3 characters relationships to the boy's constant rhythmic drumming on every available surface of the house, laying the background for the entire scene.... its hypnotic and weird moviemaking in ways you dont expect from a late 90s kiddy flick and it really set me up for all the other great stuff that happens in this</p><p>dont let the eyesore of a poster make you skip or dismiss this as empty camp - its full of gonzo sf/fantasy concepts, legit great performances, socio/religio/political commentary, belle epoque romanian locations w/ creepy eyeless bodyhorror creeps walking the streets, and the best product placement scene in movie history. recommended.</p>

<br><p>like a constrained-writing exercise fulfilling the premise "black middle class family experiences the purge" shorn of any social observations or commentary. i kinda admired how depressing &amp; hateful this was, but its mostly boring. mike epps looks like he'd rather be doing his taxes or cleaning the tub in every scene and everybody else is trying but arent funny or memorable. president george lopez saying "ive got the URGE TO PURGE" made me laff mostly just imagining it as a real line in the actual purge movies (which i havent seen). "carl black"s son being named carls jr got me too, shamefully. post credits jason cameo was fun til the movie's most annoying character literally pops out of a bush to look at the camera and say "jason vorhees???", a disappointment.</p>

<br><p>i hate to get "political" here on the ol' boxd but if u ever need an example of why movie director diversity is important this near-classic trash is essentially the same goofball h.gordon lewis riff as jackie kong's BLOOD DINER except her movie doesnt have a bunch of racist &amp; misogynist crap keeping it from being literally perfect</p><p>i expected a dipshit troma cheapie but the vibe is made-for-tv noirish, like 'cast a deadly spell' more than some bikini zombie shit where lloyd kaufman plays the president - still campy, but square as gilliam or post-crybaby waters, still legit funny, sporadically gonzo and committed to being universally gross all the time instead of just bloody. i dug this, kinda loved it - im sure it was some weird vhs kid's own lil basket case or reanimator - but, perspectives matter, art is political, and like jackie kong id rather spend my blood feast with a couple of dorky egyptian party dudes than the fucking cops</p>

<br><b>1327: Creeptales</b>
<br><p>dreamlike anthology that feels like stumbling across a 2am rerun of some cancelled tv show as a pre internet kid when there was no way to look up weird shit and prove it was real so youd tell other kids about it the next day at lunch and theyd look at u like the kid who said he saw an episode of barney where they busted the guy in the barney suit for hiding cocaine in the tail of the barney suit</p>
<br><b>1328: Escape From La</b>
<br><p>valeria golino turning up makes this feel even more like a hot shots! parody of late 90s action cinema/image comix than it already does</p><p>half this movie is dudes explaining details about xxtreme scifi weaponry john carpenter thought up while stoned</p>
<br><b>1329: The Bloody Brood</b>
<br><p>unexpectedly loved this nasty lil beatsploitation starring jack betts, baby peter falk, and 2 goons named studs &amp; weasel. theres some great, expressive close-ups, a bongo coffeeshop w/ a giant skeleton hand (???) and some leopold/loeb nihilist/nietzschean stuff to unpack but its mostly just trashy fun. if, like me, youve worn out yr copy of A BUCKET OF BLOOD try this 1</p>

HALLO-WEEN!" song in this</p><p>besides all the plagiarism this is an actually decent ol'fashioned stopmotion ghoul hoedown kinda like MAD MONSTER PARTY where all the classics (mummy, frankenstein, big-nose witch, scarecrow, zombie, really dope swamp creature) get drunk &amp; party together - most scenes are saturated w/ bittersweet creepy-fun halloween vibes and its like 27 minutes so its p much essential mood viewing right now</p><p>watch here <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x28oefk_spooky-bats-and-scaredy-cats-a-halloween-tale-2009_shortfilms" rel="nofollow">www.dailymotion.com/video/x28oefk_spooky-bats-and-scaredy-cats-a-halloween-tale-2009_shortfilms</a></p>

<br><b>1334: Serial Killer 2002</b>
<br><p>-8000 stars for having a gross creep torture strippers for like 90% of the movie but theres a scene where the protagonist threatens a fan asking for an autograph by writing YOUR DEAD on a piece of paper so +8001 stars for that / 1 star total</p>
<br><b>1335: Demon Cop</b>
<br><p>hes not a demon, hes not a cop, and hes in like 5 minutes out of 80 but i still liked when the detectives are shocked to find out his "name's not really bloodhound" !!!! :0</p>

<br><p>this sleazy, schlubby cop flick is from '97 but feels like COBRA and has so much fun / weird / cool stuff its one of my fav discoveries this year</p><p>fred williamson (who produced!) teams up w/ partner cynthia rothrock to take on smirking misogynist "VIDEO STALKER", a snuff pornographer &amp; proud vanowner who constantly scolds his victims' home movies like hes in manhunter for morons</p><p>"you got bad knees, your pile's as thick as your dick, and you make three times what a rookie makes" sez police chief robert forster in a youre-all-washed-up scene that, because this movie rules, takes place not in his office but next to a barrel fire in the parking lot of a liquor store</p><p>williamson plays DAKOTA SMITH, an alcoholic dick who guzzles sixpacks of barq's rootbeer, keeps twinkies in the fridge and jams his harley over dallas offramps to a jan hammery MIDI funk score. rothrock, as always, keeps a sly cool whether she's kicking dudes in the face or wiping a perp's brains off her peacoat with a hanky</p><p>its lowbudget vanity project so all that matters is cynth can still kick a foot* above her head and "dak" smith, in grey BVDs, fishing used coffee filter grounds out the trashbag to brew a fresh pot, is still cocky enough to spit one-liners and have his own R&amp;B theme song</p><p>i loved everything about this... just when i thought i couldnt love it any more.... bushwick bill shows up as fred's landlord ! !</p><p>so so much i dont wanna giveaway but if u REALLY still need a reason to watch this it [[[[[[$POILER$]]]]]] ends with williamson &amp; rothrock departing his AA meeting in black his'n'hers leather fringe jackets [spoilers]</p><p>WATCH THIS MOVIE</p>

<br><b>1350: Do You Wanna Know A Secret</b>
<br><p>you dont</p>
<br><b>1351: The Frightening</b>
<br><p>classic slasher death where a goth twink in fishnets gets stabbed in the chin &amp; the gore effect is just a long pin thru his preexisting tongue piercing. also the bad kid looks like a swole elliot rodger</p><p>this is lowgrade decoteau but i had fun - the SHOCKING TWIST is like the exact moment where horror shifted from late 90s scream/what-u-did-last-summer ripoffs to early 00s sixth-sense/gothika psychological junk</p>
<br><b>1352: Rumpelstiltskin 1995</b>
<br><p>was ready to give this 2 stars but then he stole the motorcycle</p>
<br><b>1353: Fifty Shades Of Black</b>
<br><p>"all signifying material of the erotic order is made up of nothing but the outfits of slaves (chains, collars, whips, etc.), savages (negritude, bronzed skin, nudity, tattooing) and all the signs of the dominated classes and races. this is how it is for the woman in her body, annexed to a phallic order which, when expressed in political terms, condemns her to a non-existence."</p><p>saw this opening weekend &amp; forgot to rvw til now but yeah goofball wayans parodies are the only new comedies i can enjoy in the feig/judd improv era and this is a necessary satire - not just a barrel of laffs, but a real recalibration of culture</p><p>being forced to make a critique of 50 shades pulls wayans out of his comfort zone - you can mock this phenomenon in 1 of 2 directions but instead of sexist panic towards woman-made fantasy that characterized most dude reactions to the book + film, wayans pushes from the left, comparing the eroticization of sexual violence &amp; patriarchal submission with slavery oscarbait &amp; liberal fetishism of black suffering, while dismissing christian grey as a stalker, sociopath, serial killer and, hilariously, menswear shoplifter. also a parody of the weeknd has a 40 inch schlong just str8 hangin out his shorts</p><p>still doesnt go as far into freaknastiness as the 2-minute doll-puppet fuckfest in A HAUNTED HOUSE 2 but not every painting can be a guernica</p>

<br><b>1358: Beyond Lemuria</b>
<br><p>my new favorite movie</p>
<br><b>1359: The Excalibur Kid</b>
<br><p>when ppl (like me!) nostalgically yearn for 90s full moon its easy to forget shit like EXCALIBUR KID, which ill call The Worst Thing Charles Band Ever Produced. i thought i liked every moonbeam production - prehysteria's dumb fun, spooky town's just great, magic in the mirror: fowl play is bewitchingly weird and ALIEN ARSENAL is one of my favorite movies, period, but no bullshit id rather watch ooga booga vs evil bong 69: dawn of killjoy than ever think about this again</p>
<br><b>1360: Mayhem Motel</b>
<br><p>this starts promisingly w/ guy in a tub puking actual red wine barf on himself &amp; a gross nerd getting his pubes shaved &amp; loogeying onto a birthday cupcake candle, but quickly turns into the worst movie ive ever seen. hateful, stupid, and predictable. no lie at least 15 minutes of this 75-minute piece of shit is two sweaty dbags in motel chairs reciting urbandictionary blurbs for shit like "boston steamer" and "donkey punch" to explain how they wanna abuse a sex worker. only the dumbest, meanest 14 yr old boy could enjoy this [cuz he wrote it]. i LOVE cheap gross ugly trash but theres nothing good or interesting about this, nothing sleazy or shocking, just boring and bad. don't watch this.</p>


<br><b>1361: The Malibu Beach Vampires</b>
<br><p>less a vampire sex romp and more a series of awkward dance numbers &amp; vaguely satirical 1991 sketch comedy bits (tv preachers, talk show hosts, ollie north) that barely qualify as a movie, but theres like 20 earnest minutes in the middle that i really liked. was hoping for assault of the killer bimbos w/ draculas and this is more like college improv talent show home video but the aesthetix (plastic fangs, neon bikinis, dance studio mirror walls) are on point and angelyne plays barbara bush so u know</p>
<br><b>1362: Task Force 2001</b>
<br><p>this is all pretty lame but they ripoff the de palma mission impossible cable drop with a dog instead of a person so i liked it </p><p>theres also a scene where a guy hides his entire body inside a "bride of pinbot" sexy robot pinball game</p><p>a lot of these moonbeam teen flix feature unnecessary casual swearing that makes them pg13 for no reason which im betting happens because charles band wont pay for a second take as long as its in focus</p>
<br><b>1363: Hyper Sapien People From Another Star</b>
<br><p>impossible-to-dislike e.t./starman hybrid set in pastoral wyoming, directed by a bond guy &amp; bankrolled by jason schwartzman's parents. charming kid actors, great turn from keenan wynn as "grandpa"... its refreshing to watch a film about fundamentally nice people. good saturday afternoon movie. make sure 2 check 4 the unreal alien dog puppet who spins like sonic the hedgehog and has a triad of buttholes for a face</p>
<br><b>1364: Gamera Guardian Of The Universe</b>
<br><p>no joke i love gamera's characterization in this</p>
<br><b>1365: The Monster Maker</b>
<br><p>boring &amp; cheap (they use the same props for 2 diff sets) but it has a guy with facial deformities playing a piano so i liked it</p>
<br><b>1366: Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday The Thirteenth</b>
<br><p>prob the closest we'll ever get to a film adaptation of mad magazine's "Hollow-Scream: It's 2 Slow"</p><p>+1 star for extended parody of christine where christine gets pulled over by a cop in the middle of a kill</p>
<br><b>1367: Circuitry Man</b>
<br><p>this is some rinkydink futureshock compared to like, trancers or slipstream or any of the italo madmaxes [cyber-punk?? more like, "cheapo-junk"] but theres enough weird + cool post-apoc ideas / characters [lu leonard as juice, mutant leech-eating dennis christopher, PLUGHEAD] to make up for it. crazy ending, cant wait for pt ii</p>
<br><b>1368: Spooky House</b>
<br><p>slept-on 70s genre hack william sachs (THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN) wrote &amp; directed this charming kiddy halloween romp that reminded me of his lazy VAN NUYS BLVD hangouts &amp; GALAXINA's screwball anything-goes kitchen-sink vibe. amazingly NOT a charles band moonbeam flick but could slot right in with any of em - dumb, cringy kidstuff mixed w/ lowkey horror cred &amp; casual adult tone (this is the only kids movie ive seen where children steal cartons of cigarettes off a truck &amp; stash em in a black funeral coffin looted from a hearse they set on fire)</p><p>sir ben kingsley, wearing either a ridiculous obsidian mane of a wig or, alternately, a mustache &amp; doorag that make him look like the iron sheik, gives a real, affecting turn as spooky house's haughty, reclusive owner - a former stage magician who quit magick when his wife was killed (??) during a performance and needs goofy kids to help him give a shit again. ben's fellow oscar-winner mercedes ruehl shows up too, taking long, hammy drags from a duplex cigarette holder &amp; camping it up villainously even when *$$POILER$!!*kingsley pulls a huge flintlock pistol on her (!!!). also one of the scumbag bully teens is a sneering, tattooed katharine isabelle (GINGER SNAPS, AMERICAN MARY, FREDDY v JASON: DAWN OF JUSTICE) </p><p>full of junk like creepy dolls, trapdoors, secret bookshelf passages, paintings with the eyes cut out so u can lookthru, refs to THE FLY and TOURIST TRAP, cobwebbed hallways, leafy orange autumn smalltown mood, and -----a baby goat on a rope---- all of which almost makes up for the worst soundtrack ive maybe ever heard in a movie. besides a generic symphonic score, this is crammed w/ unlistenable shit that sounds like the christian boyband from the left behind end credits, a bland "thriller"-biting theme by Boyz-N-Girlz-United, and a sped-up hypnotism montage set to, no lie, the vengaboys "WE LIKE TO PARTY" [predating those six flags commercials, creepier than anything in this, by 2 years]. they even got 90s crip rapper domino (of "ghetto jam" + the tales from the hood OST) to record a halfdecent track called "SPOOKY THANG".... and then left it out of the movie!!!!! </p><p>idk all that said maybe i was in a sentimental mood but this won me over like a dummy &amp; i loved spooky house</p>

<br><p>campy one-liners, locker room antics, rubber martians w/ booby eyes, the car chase from DR ALIEN &amp; the lab shelves from KILLER EYE - this is such a david decoteau movie even the girl's robot suit has molded pecs &amp; abs - top 5 best davey d imo check it out !!!</p>
<br><b>1377: The Life Zone</b>
<br><p>cant rate this ugly anti-choice torture porn. the most vile, reprehensible thing ive ever added here but a must-watch for the same reasons. some bad movies are boring, some are inspiring, nourishing. this one drains you. </p><p>its like they heard the slogan "forced maternity = slavery" and thought hey thats a good idea - 3 pregnant women abducted, held captive by moralizing sadists who implant tracking devices &amp; shackle them into 7 months of gestation &amp; brainwashing. the captors, who we're meant to find reasonable????, are blanche baker's "dr. victoria wise", evoking creepy fundamentalist smarm so well im not convinced she's acting, and poor old robert loggia [r.i.p.] playing his rightwing cultist senator from WILD PALMS who turns out 2 be [[[spoilers]]] #SATAN [[[ O_O ]]]. </p><p>these 2 zealots inflict lame amateur videos of "the abortion debate" on enslaved women, women trapped in a bunker suffering morning sickness &amp; apocalyptic nightmares of racist stock footage [hitler, nosferatu, costumed tribal dancers] and, in one transcendent scene, adults who scream with the cries of infants. this is how they choose to present their beliefs, to these women, to us. </p><p>[speaking of racism our 2 "good" kidnap victims [who feel their captors make lots of solid points &amp; [spoiler] ascend to heaven] are german-american &amp; bubbly blonde mississippian, while the movie makes sure we know the shrill feminist doomed to eternal hell is named HOROWITZ &gt;:| ]</p><p>its cheap &amp; didactic, but it works as horror because i felt like shit the whole time. ugh. i dunno, im glad this exists - im glad the cruel misogynists who made this piece of shit staged a "debate" on reproductive rights that feels like a human centipede movie. its disgusting &amp; it portrays the anti-woman motive of "pro life" politics better than anything ive ever seen</p>

WHO COULD IT BE????? this unexpectedly sincere flick comes off like director katherine hicks got drafted to make a hallmark channel movie of SKULLDUGGERY but only had a camcorder, a 12pack &amp; a hangover. "so you're saying if we played monopoly.... there'd be a BOOT comin' to kick us all in the ASS??"/// some of the most useless movie cops in history &amp; the security guard is NOT scared of d&amp;d players. child actor has to be seen to be believed. great liquor store scenes. also a christmas movie!</p>

<br><p>eric roberts ("JERSEYDUDE") is a single dad with a single earring who spends lunchbreaks at his casino job logging onto sexxxy A/S/L chatrooms &amp; saying stuff like "come to papa". anne heche ("SEXYKITTENONLY4U") is a bored pittsburgh mom/housewife who only leaves the house to sell mary kay knockoffs &amp; sing really embarrassing karaoke. in a virtual suite of thirsty nerds named "gothicbod" and "ginormous" they meet, 1st in the chatroom + then irl to have lots of neon-lit stilettos-on-the-car-windows sex. she says he looks like steve mcqueen (???). he says she looks like "michelle pfeiffer mixed with melanie griffith" (???????). its cyber-luv at 1st byte! </p><p>this is way way better than a movie w/ opening credits in the apple macintosh font has any right to be. i expected roberts to be the sleazy middleaged creep webstalking/exploiting naive damsel heche but they both go lots more interesting places in their performances &amp; characters. the early courtship is actually kinda sweet and i love how heche smirks &amp; vamps like a 90s erotic thriller femme. she writes terrible poetry &amp; sends nekkid webcam vidz &amp; eric roberts explains why he named his dick george ("because he's curious"). there's lotsa dumb stuff like that to laff at ("this brazilian chick wants to jump my bones.. how do you say BRING IT ON in spanish??") but both actors are just great &amp; the whole thing is unexpectedly melancholy &amp; stylish, especially a drunken binge &amp; arrest scored to what sounds like the pink room from fire walk with me. this movie rules.</p>


<br><b>1400: Goodbye Lover</b>
<br><p>this is one of those smug 90s movies where its supposed to be real hilarious &amp; satirical that somebody listens to self-help tapes, the kinda movie where instead of writing an ending to a scene they just pan over to a tv showing martha stewart or a thighmaster commercial &amp; lazily expect a laugh, alexander payne style</p><p>couldve been sleazy backstabbing fun like WILD THINGS or CRUEL INTENTIONS instead of joining the many selfrighteous lol@normies 98/99 flicks if it wasnt so goddam pleased with itself. what the fuck was up in the late 90s??? politicians are dishonest! people desire luxury items! boy wouldnt it be DELICIOUS if a shitty person was really into some syrupy crap like the sound of music &amp; we established it over &amp; over &amp; over??? (answer: no)</p><p>don johnson is good &amp; i'll always luv maneating snaggletooth arquette but it doesnt really come alive til an hour in, when cynical noir detective ellen degeneres shows up dropping endless fbombs eating endless corndogs and calling her devout mormon partner a pencildick. shes the best thing in this just cuz how pissed she is at how dumb &amp; lame everybody else is. good flick to watch if u wanna see [SPOILERS] ellen shoot vincent gallo in the face and chest multiple times.

<br><p>wow i dug this genuinely enjoyable kids flick from the director of house 2: the second story &amp; one of the many, many children of the corn sequels </p><p>wee-man from jackass (or "JACKA**" as it says on the back of the dvd) is a depressive, alienated elf who doesnt really give a shit about anything. usually childrens movies dont offer up believable xmas grumps but i really bought wee-man as shitty &amp; disaffected about xmas in a way that didnt just seem like he was personally bored to be in the movie. </p><p>santa fucks up &amp; leaves wee-man behind at the house of a ripoff wayne szalinski dad who just invented this laws-of-thermodynamics-disobeying infinite energy device so game-changing it's being hunted down by not one, not two, but THREE dumb robbers in a white van. one of the crooks is JEFFREY COMBS!! doing better work than all his recent mighty morphin power rangers level kiddy crap. instead of goofing around getting knocked down by a big dog or something he gets to deliver lots of foreboding dr.loomis monologues about dealing with murderous elfin creatures and being an ex navy SEAL (???). you can tell this movie loves jeffrey combs!</p><p>i cant pretend its a classic but wee-man is legit good as a cynical, insecure reindeer shit-shoveler - years of drinking &amp; physical abuse give him a world-weariness that grownup former child stars cant fake, and when he needs to turn on the xmas spirit in the end it actually feels earned. maybe i'm crazy but little bits of this felt ripe &amp; kinky the way kids movies used to be, like theyd finally produced a lost PG empire pictures script that'd been sitting in a drawer for 25 yrs next to the TROLL prequel. its conventional &amp; tv-movieish but theres these weird, smart touches and jokes that kept me watching even when it got cornball.</p><p>extra half-star for qualifying to be on the KILLER BAKED GOODS list!! <a href="http://i.imgur.com/yqwCctX.jpg" rel="nofollow">i.imgur.com/yqwCctX.jpg</a></p>

<br><b>1427: Bloody Mama</b>
<br><p>not quite the misandrist bloodbath i wanted, this is still a grimy, delirious trip. shelley winters is the greatest actor of her (+every) generation and corman takes on "america" as harsh &amp; unforgiving as anything from the decade - ma's posse of boys are brutal, glue-sniffing clods, their father a useless sperm donor, and cheap b&amp;w newsreels are an ugly hoedown of guns, greed, lynchings and "mothers of america" stamps. furious satire that still delivers sleazy b thrills &amp; dynamite camp. x10 better than bonnie &amp; clyde. were the 30s in the 60s like the 80s in the 10s???? </p><p>p.s. arizona barker was an innocent woman murdered by the fbi &amp; j.edgar hoover concocted the "ma barker" lie to cover it up the barker gang was controlled by st. paul police chief tom brown who was demoted but never faced justice for his crimes. never trust cops</p>

<br><p>shit</p>
<br><b>1431: 90210 Shark Attack</b>
<br><p>aka A Talking Shark?!?!</p><p>a fat, cheezy slice of of trademark 00s decoteau. instead of linnea quigley or michelle bauer we get a grizzled donna wilkes from jaws 2 camping it up saying shit like "all i know about the ocean is she guards her secrets well..." in a house of endless ab-rubbing &amp; hip/torso shots inspired by d'angelo's untitled video. the score veers from cutesy richard band licks to trendy carpenter-esque synthpads to generic triphop cues bought from the same company that provides beverly hills stock footage for every exterior shot in the movie. theres also a cgi shark that looks like the 3d hologram from back to the future 2</p><p>this actually has a really dope concept/premise (designed around "how do u make a killer shark movie entirely inside a house") but of course the execution is hilariously lame. i liked all the dumb twists and appealingly offkilter lead (a horny jock calls her a "nerdling") and it has enough of decoteau's goofy charm to wish this was made in 1991 w/ brinke stevens &amp; some john carl buechler shark puppets</p>

<br><p>the most entertaining todd sheets flick ive seen. less gory than GOBLIN but a lot more fun. heavy decoteau vibes (him &amp; fred olen ray both get thanked in the credits). most of the jokes are abbott &amp; costello/bibleman-level groaners but this movie has a loony, creepy, dreamlike energy &amp; gleeful desire to entertain in every dumb scene. an unexpected ref to "crazy fat ethel" was one of the best surprises ive got lately. this is top-shelf SOV bad taste, highly recommended.</p>

<br><b>1438: Solarman</b>
<br><p>better-than-average kids cartoon w/ cool scifi action that reminded me of BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS. a dainty teen boy w/ a dope lighthouse-view oceanfront bedroom ponders how to tell his dad he's "not into macho stuff" ("itd be easier if mom was still alive"). he helps a dying blue man from the sky so the alien gifts him a bracelet &amp; says to press a button when the sun hits &amp; stuff'll happen. next day the nerd is chased by 2 greenfaced terminators and does the sun thing which turns this darkhaired olive-skinned geek into a blonde aryan ubermensch. i dug how non-masc/femme the kid was - 1st thing he says when he turns into solarman is "...i'm a hunk... FANTABULOUS!". also check for when the cyborg spacevillain puts his entire palm on a robot's face &amp; slowly melts him into flickering yellow sludge. 4 stars!</p>

<br><p>this christian short looked so slick &amp; professional i expected generic salvation mush w/ faith-on-trial persecution complex but this is anything but generic</p><p>it starts off as an evangelical dreams in the witch house: college student who looks &amp; acts like david herman from MADtv falls asleep (??) while pondering an apparently baffling m.c. escher rip-off (the one with the stairs) and finds himself straitjacketed in a jail cell with a grizzled, heston-esque lunatic ranting about the real names of god and jesus (both of which he pronounces 5 or 6 different, hilarious ways - "yahweh, yah-hohweah, ya-haaawoooah, YEAH-WO, YAHHHHHHOOOOOO!!!")</p><p>a sexy nurse/prison guard in high heels keeps barging in to coo condescendingly and, eventually, dump out a bowl of campbells original chicken noodle, which spookily turns into a bowl of campbells original chicken noodle with a few worms in it. the woman is the devil, or possibly eve/lilith, and the movie demands she act like a flirty male fuck fantasy while condemning her for it. the crazy man gives the student a rock with some hebrew on it. </p><p>i cant even explain how weird this opening scene is ‐ it's not a message of love or salvation or giving your heart to christ blah blah it's just a big explicit fuck you to christians who dont say "yahweh" and "yeshua". i like to think i keep up w/ intramural evangelical disputes (like KJV fanatics who think NIV was written by satan) but i never knew ppl got so heated about this... this dude is really going hard on the name "jesus"!!! he also shoves the lady out the door, in case the misogyny was too subtle </p><p>the 2nd half is where this movie goes from whaa to WHAT? -- if you love the classroom scene in neil labute's WICKER MAN (&amp; if u dont gtfo my page loser) yr head will xplode!~! leaving the cell for a schoolhouse (the jail cell, redressed) where the evil nurse/guard is now a teacher forcing schoolkids to eat the o.g. eden apple from the tree of knowledge, we then rush thru a series of allegorical rooms that reveal the evils of megachurches, vaccines, trick-or-treating, money, politics, GMO foods, and, no joke, the easter bunny. a (real!) torah scroll is on fire, burning on a podium while nurse/guard/teacher is now a pastor with a statue of liberty crown, sermonizing to a chained congregation. the student rubs the hebrew rock on their chains and they break! its like a living, breathing <a href="http://ddees.com/index.php/2015/09/11/david-dees-art-gallery/" rel="nofollow">dees illustration</a> and its one of the best surprises any movie has given me this year</p><p>recommended!</p>


<br><b>1464: Basic Instinct</b>
<br><p>found a lot to relate to in this story of an alcoholic loser getting drunk and watching hellraiser &amp; the jeffersons</p>
<br><b>1465: Bernard And The Genie</b>
<br><p>racist fish-out-of-water "comedy" where sour weenie alan cummings summons a magical genie &amp; does nothing interesting for 70 unbearable minutes. why would an african (???) genie keep explaining "in my country..." about shit like not knowing how to use a phone or eat ice cream?? he's been in a damn lamp 2000 years thats why he doesnt know shit!!! everybody in whatever country hes "from" knows how to use phones and eat ice cream RIGHT NOW so he should be saying "in my time..." but whatever limey schoolboy piece of shit wrote this abomination hates immigrants and thought it was funny to make an afro-jamaican british actor not understand london "civilization" &amp; act like a dumb child</p><p>fuck this movie</p><p>half-star for rowan atkinson</p>


<br><b>1466: Demon Slaughter</b>
<br><p>when the cool trenchcoat hitman has a meeting with the mafia bosses in a fancy mob hangout named MERLIN'S that serves pb&amp;j and pizza subs w/ ruffles chips and has WIZARDS / WITCHES signs on the bathroom doors....... thats when i knew this was 5 stars</p>
<br><b>1467: The Legend Of Bigfoot</b>
<br><p>this is deep as hell</p>
<br><b>1468: The Annihilators</b>
<br><p>atlantans will be SHOCKED to witness the gory shit thats gone down inside little's food store </p><p>need to ask oldtimers if the graf was real and '80s castleberry hill had giant pentagrams &amp; dripping heroin needles tagged on every alley wall</p>
<br><b>1469: The Shadow 1994</b>
<br><p>parts of the score really sound like the puppet master theme</p>
<br><b>1470: Dead Heat</b>
<br><p>goofball action/horror cop buddy comedy full of sick kills &amp; fangoria-approved monster puppetry like the gr8est hits of tango &amp; cash, re-animator, maniac cop + big troubz in little china in a big dumbo blender set on ehhhhh. u just know the studio thought they made this year's ghostbusters - wisecracking ex-SNL star versus crazy fx slime monsters, CANT MISS! - but its R-rated ultraviolent and piscopo is never funny or charming so this "died" after literally 1 week in theaters</p><p>tone is all over the place, every wannabe riggs/foley one-liner dies onscreen (my fat ex-wife!) but theres some fun, loopy dialogue, like when piscopo swears for a kill he will "personally rip his heart out with my bare hands, hold it in the palm of my hand, and we'll watch it stop beating, together." i was laffing my azz off every action scene where treat williams gets shot 50 times and keeps going (spoiler??). srsly the FX work in this is so fuckin awesome i was checking the end credits for buechler or nicotero or gabe bartalos but it was some dude i never heard of - trust me this is some of the best gore/monster ish anybody did in the 80s or after &amp; u already know if that makes a must-watch 4u</p><p>kinda drags in the middle, when treat sobs out a sad, inadvertently autobiographical lament about dying alone &amp; unloved ("my time is up") but picks up a TON when a fiery ambulance crash turns him into a two-face/beetlejuice for an extended terminator rip-off sequence. also best bathroom body decay outside of BODY MELT for the boring love interest.</p><p>for some reason the whole movie is weirdly underpopulated?? theres like... 6 ppl in the whole thing. and the big reveal (who cares) of badguy darren mcgavin was scooby doo-level obvious because there is literally no-'body' else in the movie it could be. another big reveal/death of a main character is so confusingly half-assed it feels like poochie's return to his home planet. aside from a very tired VINCENT PRICE (who performs his first scene in a bed buried under a blanket in a video playing on a monitor, like they bought his video will at an estate auction) casting is fun - def a joe dante thing goin on (keye luke &amp; robert picardo costar) and theres a linnea quigley cameo if u keep track of that sorta thing</p><p>two jokes at the end really knock it out the park - one bit, a security guard watching vincent price's raising-the-dead monologue on a B&amp;W security cam t.v. like its a long-lost 50s horror flick, is quick &amp; brilliant - and (!ACTUAL SPOILER) treat'n'piscopo immediately reviving darren mcgavin after his suicide so they can have the gleeful satisfaction of killing him again is almost too good to be true, like the end of macgruber</p><p>RECOMMENDED</p>


<br><b>1471: End Of The Harvest</b>
<br><p>"enough of these... BIBLE MATHEMATICS" - student in classroom / me</p><p>went in expecting rapture thriller and instead got the o.g. GOD'S NOT DEAD, starring the boring pastor from the "car trouble" subplot in GOD'S NOT DEAD, here with a dawsons creek/devon sawa in final destination/teenage jason robards look goin on, in what is essentially GOD'S NOT DEAD if the kid didn't debate hercules: the legendary journeys and instead droned on about the end times to a "humorously" skeptical college classroom</p><p>once i got what was going on, i found myself kinda digging the mr.x-in-JFK vibe of narrating arcane/esoteric armageddon prophecies over xfiles synth pads, but they kept hedging bets and coming back to generic salvation crap. i know a lot of ppl watch shit like this just to clown it but my fav evangelical propaganda is about shit i'm genuinely interested in - conspiracies, subliminal messages, demons, the occult, numerology, pornography, witches, etc - and this gets a little better when it goes into the last 20 minutes. but not enough.</p><p>lots of shitty asides about how jews need to come around on the whole jesus deal - "when christ came, israel rejected him as the messiah, so god scattered them all around the world" &lt;&lt; what a dick</p><p>"you ever met a canaanite, frank? how bout an amorite? no. because these were israel's enemies. but the jews are still rejecting christ!"</p><p>having an old lady in a pink mary kay blazer as the most vocal bitchy christian taunter was fun but set up an incredibly dumb twist that made me yell at the TV</p><p>so yeah, prob the lamest rapture/end-times flick ive ever watched. this makes left behind ii: tribulation force look like megiddo: the omega code 2, but its still better than god's not dead.</p>


<br><b>1472: Invisible Enemies</b>
<br><p>really enjoyable christian THEY LIVE wannabe where a kid inherits demon-revealing glasses from his dad</p><p>at one point dad sets up a flashback, dead serious, with "it was like a slow-motion swan dive into a toilet... and i was dying inside."</p>

<br><b>1478: Gorgon Video Magazine</b>
<br><p>"working in horror gives you tremendous freedom as an artist, because it deals with all those other realities. there's not hard and fast rules about what you can show in a horror film. you can go beyond all the rules, beyond the limits. you can deal with strange and bizarre states of reality that most films simply don't go into at all." - wes craven [gorgon video magazine (1989)]</p>

<br><b>1481: The Creation Adventure Team A Jurassic Ark Mystery</b>
<br><p>smug misogynist comic brad stine as smug atheist professor "dr. noah tall" (get it) w/ rick perry glasses &amp; an uncle sam chinbeard struggling to mutter intellectual-ish adlibs in front of a dino skeleton while a lady reporter tries on a VR helmet that transports her to THE X-TINCT FILES, a timely parody featuring agents "moler" (huh?) and "scaley" </p><p>[THE TRUTH IS IN HERE over a photo of bible pages]</p><p>agent scaley is a jim henson-y prosthetic creation who looks like a deviant-art photoshop of what a "realistic" baby bop from barney &amp; friends would look like, wearing a men's suit. he talks in about 80 comedy accents (yokel, brit, john wayne, aussie, valley girl) for no reason</p><p>some nice dino effects (practical &amp; CGI, in a hilarious "dragons were dinosaurs!" sequence) and lotsa matrix-green terminator-vision onscreen displays w/ over-edited cut'n'pasted stock footage (ala HACKERS) cant hide the fact that they're spending 45 minutes desperately trying to come up with new ways to say "you don't know what happened! you weren't there!"</p><p>3 stars</p>

"shotgun" is a police officer who had no problem with his sister working in prostitution, while the bad guy says shit like "they weren't people, they were hookers", which puts this above 95% of 80s action (and uh movies in general) :/ also everybody calls BDSM dudes "kinkos" which i think is why kinko's now goes by fedex office</p><p>"c'mon over ian... you can have one too many beers and figure out why the system fell apart" ... "you don't have that many beers."</p><p>they try to do the lethal weapon scene where murtaugh invites riggs over for dinner but even though he's married "murtaugh"s place looks like a college dorm room</p><p>"money talks... and the asshole walks" </p><p>now christened "shotgun jones", ian gets a MIDI theme song that plays over a montage of him building a tank out of scrap metal </p><p>favorite scene was when grieving ian talks about his murdered sister kicking a guy in the nuts and chokes up crying on the word "nuts"</p><p>recommended</p>
